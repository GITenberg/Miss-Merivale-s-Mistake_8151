    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. A STARTLING DISCOVERY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale had not been paying much heed to the eager talk that was
      going on between Rose and Pauline Smythe at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long drive from Woodcote had made her head ache, and she was drowsily
      wishing that Miss Smythe would get her the cup of tea she had promised,
      when the sound of a name made her suddenly sit bolt upright, her kind old
      face full of anxious curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rhoda Sampson, the creature calls herself,&rdquo; Pauline was saying in her
      clear, high-pitched voice. &ldquo;Her people live in Kentish Town, or somewhere
      in the dim wilds about there. You would know it by just looking at her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she come from Kentish Town every day?&rdquo; asked Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three times a week. On the top of an omnibus, one may be sure. And she
      imbibes facts from <i>The Civil Service Geography</i> all the way. I found
      the book in her bag yesterday. I believe she wants to get into the Post
      Office eventually. It is a worthy ambition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom are you talking of, my dears?&rdquo; asked Miss Merivale from her seat by
      the fire. Pauline turned round with a little stare. Miss Merivale was so
      quiet and unassuming a personage that she had got into the habit of
      ignoring her. &ldquo;Of Clare&rsquo;s new amusement, Miss Merivale,&rdquo; she said, with a
      laugh. Her laugh, like her voice, was a trifle hard. &ldquo;It was scientific
      dressmaking when I was at Woodcote last, you remember, Rose dear. Now it
      is a society. Clare is secretary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you spoke of some girl who came here,&rdquo; persisted Miss Merivale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline lifted her delicately-pencilled eyebrows. &ldquo;Oh, that is Clare&rsquo;s
      typewriter. She is part of the joke. If you saw Clare and her together
      over their letters, you would think they were reforming the universe. It
      hasn&rsquo;t dawned on poor Sampson yet that Clare will get tired of the whole
      business in a month. It is lucky she has the Post Office to fall back on.
      Clare is exactly what she used to be at school, Rose, &lsquo;everything by
      starts and nothing long.&rsquo; It amuses me to watch her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t tire of you, Pauline,&rdquo; said Rose fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline frowned a little. She did not care to be reminded, even by
      foolish, flattering little Rose, that she was, in sober fact, nothing more
      nor less than Clare&rsquo;s paid companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we get on,&rdquo; she said coolly. &ldquo;We each leave the other to go her own
      way in peace. And it suits Lady Desborough in Rome to say that Clare is
      living with her old governess. People think of me as a spectacled lady of
      an uncertain age, and everybody is satisfied. But you would like some tea.
      I wish Clare was in. She isn&rsquo;t afraid of that gas stove. I am ashamed to
      confess that I am. Come out with me while I light it, Rosamunda mia. And
      you shall make the tea. I never can remember how many spoonfuls to put in.
      How pretty you look in blue! I wish I was eighteen, with hair the colour
      of ripe wheat, then I would wear blue too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went off, laughing, with Rose to the tiny kitchen on the other side of
      the passage. The sitting-room was the largest room in the little Chelsea
      flat, and that was smaller than any of the rooms at Woodcote; but the
      diminutive dimensions of the place only added to the fascinations of it in
      Rose&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she took the cups and saucers down from the toy-like dresser and put
      them on the lilliputian table between the gas stove and the door, she felt
      a thrill of ineffable pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Pauline, I wish I lived here with you. It&rsquo;s so dull at Woodcote. And
      it seems to get duller every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little Rose, it must be dull for you. Clare and I often talk of you
      with pity. Clare pities you the most. A fellow-feeling makes us wondrous
      kind, you know. She will have to go back to Desborough Park when her
      mother returns, I suppose. The flat is only rented for six months. I wish&rdquo;&mdash;She
      stopped to take off the lid of the tea-kettle and peer earnestly in. &ldquo;When
      a kettle boils, little bubbles come to the top, don&rsquo;t they? I have got a
      notebook where I write down interesting little details of that sort. They
      will come useful by and by, if I have to live in a flat by myself. I
      shouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep a regular servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a regular servant would spoil it all, even if you could afford it,&rdquo;
       said Rose, with sparkling eyes. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t come out here and get tea
      like this, if you had a servant, Pauline.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would have to stand in the passage, wouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said Pauline,
      looking round the tiny kitchen, with a laugh. &ldquo;But how would you like to
      get tea for yourself every day, little Rose? Clare seems to like it,
      though. Her mother wanted Mrs. Richards to stay with us all day, but Clare
      begged that she might go at three o&rsquo;clock. And Clare is maid-of-all-work
      after that. It seems to come natural to her to know what kitchen things
      are meant for. Now, if you will make the tea, we will go back to your
      aunt. This kettle is certainly boiling at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose carefully measured the tea into the pretty Japanese teapot. Pauline
      leant against the dresser and watched her with her hands clasped at the
      back of her head. Pauline was not pretty,&mdash;her features were badly
      cut and her skin was sallow,&mdash;but she made a pretty picture standing
      there. Her dress of ruddy brown was made in a graceful, artistic fashion,
      and was just the right colour to set off her dark eyes and dark, wavy
      hair. Rose thought her friend beautiful. She had adored her from the first
      day they met, when Pauline was junior English governess at Miss Jephson&rsquo;s
      Collegiate School for Young Ladies at Brighton, and Rose was a frightened,
      lonely, homesick child of fourteen, tasting her first experience of
      boarding-school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline had had many adorers among the younger girls, and a holiday rarely
      passed without her receiving some delightful invitations. It was
      spitefully noticed by the senior English governess that she was very
      rarely invited twice to the same house; but after Rose came to the school,
      it became a matter of course that Pauline should spend her holidays at
      Woodcote. She had no home of her own, as she often sadly told the girls.
      She very seldom said more than that, but it was understood in the school
      that the seal ring she wore at her watch-chain belonged to her father, one
      of the Norfolk Smythes; and the beautiful woman with powdered hair, whose
      miniature hung in her bedroom, was her great-grandmother, the Marquise de
      Villeroy, who perished on the scaffold during the Reign of Terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was considered a high privilege by Pauline&rsquo;s band of worshippers to be
      allowed to hold this miniature in their hands; but on Rose a still higher
      privilege had been once conferred. She had worn the miniature tied round
      her neck by a blue ribbon when she acted a part in the French play Miss
      Jephson&rsquo;s pupils produced every Christmas. That was in Rose&rsquo;s last year at
      school. She left at the end of the next term, as her aunt was in failing
      health and wanted her at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Pauline left too, and after a brief experience as a private
      governess, commenced to give visiting lessons in London. She lived at
      first with a cousin of Miss Jephson&rsquo;s, a clergyman&rsquo;s widow; but the
      arrangement did not somehow prove a satisfactory one, and it was a relief
      to them both when Clare Desborough, whose old admiration for Pauline had
      revived on meeting her in London, had begged her to share the little flat
      her mother had consented to rent for her, while the family spent the
      winter in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline found the freedom of a flat delightful, and looked forward with a
      sinking heart to the day of Lady Desborough&rsquo;s return. Her only hope was
      that Rose might be induced to entreat her aunt to let her live in London,
      so that she might study music at the Royal Academy. Pauline was sure that
      Miss Merivale would consent, if only Rose&rsquo;s pleading was urgent enough.
      Rose had had her own way all her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration: PAULINE LEANT AGAINST THE DRESSER AND WATCHED HER.}
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, it is quite ready now,&rdquo; Rose said, as she finished cutting the
      bread and butter. &ldquo;If you will move a little, Pauline, I will carry the
      tray in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to do that,&rdquo; said Pauline lazily. &ldquo;What will your aunt think,
      Rosie? I am not treating you like a visitor, am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I wasn&rsquo;t a visitor,&rdquo; said Rose, with a faint little sigh. &ldquo;I envy
      Clare more than I ever envied anybody. She must be having a lovely time.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;It will soon be over, poor dear. I wish&rdquo;&mdash;Pauline stopped again, and
      began a fresh sentence. &ldquo;You and I would get on better than Clare and I
      do, Rose. We like the same things. She does not care a bit for music, but
      I can&rsquo;t live without it. What delightful times we could have together,
      Rose! But I don&rsquo;t suppose your aunt would hear of it. She is more
      old-fashioned in her ideas than Lady Desborough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose had clasped her hands together. &ldquo;Oh, Pauline, it would be too
      delightful! Would you really like to have me? Aunt Lucy might let me come,
      though I&rsquo;m afraid she could not get on without me. And there&rsquo;s Tom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline&rsquo;s dark eyes grew quizzical &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were afraid of Tom,
      Rose. Doesn&rsquo;t he think everything you do is right? Was there ever a little
      girl so spoiled by a big brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he thinks I ought always to be at home to wait on him. You said the
      other day that he was selfish, Pauline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All brothers are, my dear,&rdquo; returned Pauline oracularly, &ldquo;and it is
      sisters who make them so. Come, strike a blow for your liberty, Rose. You
      are not really wanted at home, and you are wasting your days in that dull
      little country place. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to live here with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose&rsquo;s face was answer enough. She drew a deep breath before she spoke.
      &ldquo;If only Aunt Lucy wouldn&rsquo;t miss me too much, Pauline! But she&rsquo;s not
      strong. I don&rsquo;t think she could do without me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would be better if she came up to London oftener and had a fuller
      life,&rdquo; returned Pauline, with decision. &ldquo;Her ill health has always been
      mainly imaginary, Rose. When people have nothing else to do, they sink
      into invalidism. But you are making me lose my character as a hostess
      altogether. Let us take in the tea. Your aunt will wonder what we have
      been doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Merivale had not noticed that the tea was a long time in making
      its appearance. She was still absorbed in anxious thought when the girls
      came in, and after a little while she managed to lead the conversation
      back to Clare and her typewriter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Powell suggested that we should have the programmes for the concert
      typewritten, Rose. He said it would be cheaper. Could you give me the
      address of Miss Sampson, Miss Smythe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t advise you to employ her, Miss Merivale,&rdquo; returned Pauline in
      a voice that had a sharp edge to it. For some reason or other, Clare&rsquo;s
      assistant was evidently not a favourite of hers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she
      knows her business properly. Lady Desborough&rsquo;s sister picked her up for
      Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might try her. Could you give me her address, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline opened her eyes. It was utterly unlike Miss Merivale to be so
      persistent. &ldquo;I am afraid I can&rsquo;t, Miss Merivale. I know nothing whatever
      about her, except that she has just come from Australia with some
      relations who kept a small shop out there. It was foolish of Mrs. Metcalfe
      to send us such a person. There are so many ladies who would be glad to do
      the work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale had caught her breath sharply as Pauline mentioned
      Australia, but neither of the girls noticed her agitation. Rose had
      wandered to the window, and was looking with delight at the vast expanse
      of chimney-tops, and the little glimpse of the river, grey under the cold
      March sky. And Pauline was slowly stirring her tea, with her eyes cast
      down. She was thinking whether it would be wise to drop a hint about
      Rose&rsquo;s unhappiness at Woodcote. She had just made up her mind to say a
      guarded word or two, when she found, to her sharp annoyance, that Miss
      Merivale&rsquo;s mind was still running on Rhoda Sampson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She comes here three times a week, I think you said, my dear?&rdquo; asked Miss
      Merivale in her gentle voice. &ldquo;Does she come in the mornings? She has her
      meals here, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline laughed. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t invited her yet. I told Clare she must draw
      the line somewhere. There is a Lockhart&rsquo;s Coffee House round the corner,
      and she goes there. What makes you interested in her, Miss Merivale? If
      you want some typewriting done, I can easily get a proper person for you.
      Mrs. Metcalfe got Sampson because she is so cheap. She comes to Clare, on
      Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, for some ridiculous sum. If she knew
      her work, she would have wanted more. In fact, she told Clare that she
      knew very little. Rose, what are you looking at? Do you find the company
      of chimney-tops exhilarating? I wish our flat was in the front of the
      building. Then we could have a good view of the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a delightful glimpse of it here,&rdquo; Rose said, without turning her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline smiled and looked at Miss Merivale. &ldquo;Rose is in the mood to find
      even London smuts fascinating,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Could you spare her to us for a
      night or two next week, Miss Merivale? Joachim is playing at St. James&rsquo;s
      Hall, and I want Rose to hear him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale started from a deep reverie. &ldquo;Tom talked of bringing her up
      for Joachim&rsquo;s concert,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But if Rose would like to stay a day or
      two&mdash;But have you room for a visitor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose had come from the window, her eyes sparkling at Pauline&rsquo;s suggestion
      that she should stay with her and Clare. She now broke merrily in.
      &ldquo;Clare&rsquo;s two cousins stayed with them for a night last week, Aunt Lucy.
      You don&rsquo;t know how elastic a flat is. Does she, Pauline? Oh, do let me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Rose had been pleading to be let out of prison she could not have
      spoken more earnestly. Another time Miss Merivale might have been hurt,
      but just then she was hardly able to attend to what Rose was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must ask Tom about the concert,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You can write to Miss
      Smythe to-morrow. Would any day next week be convenient, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any day,&rdquo; said Pauline smilingly. &ldquo;But the sooner the better. Be sure and
      bring your violin, Rose. I want Mrs. Metcalfe to hear you play. She is a
      brilliant performer herself. We must have a musical afternoon while you
      are here. Don&rsquo;t you think you could spare her for a week, Miss Merivale?
      We shall have so much to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will see, my dear,&rdquo; said Miss Merivale, getting up. &ldquo;A week sounds a
      long time. But we will see. We must go now, Rosie. The carriage will be
      waiting. You and Miss Desborough must come and see us, my dear. I am sure
      even a day in the country would be good for you. Don&rsquo;t you pine for the
      country now the spring is coming?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. WOODCOTE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The drive home to Woodcote was a very silent one. Miss Merivale and Rose
      were both absorbed in their own thoughts, and neither of them even dimly
      divined the thoughts of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had never entered Miss Merivale&rsquo;s head that Rose, her pet and darling,
      her little nurse and helper, could be longing to live with Pauline in
      London; and how could Rose have guessed that her aunt&rsquo;s thoughts were
      fixed on Rhoda Sampson, the girl Pauline had spoken of in such
      contemptuous terms? She supposed her aunt was asleep, she sat so still in
      the corner of the carriage with her eyes closed, and she took good care
      not to disturb her. She was glad to be free to dwell on the delightful
      visions Pauline had called up for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale roused herself as the carriage turned in at the gates of the
      drive. The March twilight had gathered thickly, and lights were shining
      from the windows of the low, irregular house. They could see them
      twinkling through the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if Tom is back from Guilford yet, Rosie. He will scold us for
      being late. Oh, how sweet and fresh the air is here! Don&rsquo;t you pity those
      girls cooped up in that stuffy little flat? You must not promise to stay a
      week with them, Rosie. You would find two days quite long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose was saved from attempting to answer this by the carriage stopping
      before the wide porch. A short, fair-haired young man, with a pleasant
      face and merry blue eyes, was waiting to open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie, you have no business to be out as late as this and an east wind
      blowing,&rdquo; he said, in a playful scolding tone. &ldquo;Rose, you should not have
      allowed it. But come in. There is a jolly fire in the dining-room, and tea
      is quite ready. Next time you go to London, I mean to go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dining-room looked a picture of comfort, with the curtains drawn, and
      the table laid for tea. Miss Merivale never had late dinner except when
      she gave a dinner party. She liked the simple, old-fashioned ways she had
      been accustomed to in her youth. But the table was laid with dainty care;
      the swinging lamps shone upon shining silver that had been in the family
      for two hundred years, on an old Worcester tea-set that had been bought by
      Miss Merivale&rsquo;s grandmother, on bowls of early spring flowers gathered by
      Rose that morning from the beautiful old garden at the back of the house.
      Everything in the room spoke of long years of quiet prosperity. As Miss
      Merivale took her accustomed seat at the tea-table and looked about her,
      and then at Tom sitting opposite her, all unwitting of the terrible blow
      that might be about to fall on him, she could scarcely keep back the sob
      that rose to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom met her glance without seeing the trouble in it, and he smiled
      cheerfully back at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how did the shopping get on?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;Did you remember the
      seeds, Rose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose gave him a guilty look. &ldquo;Oh, Tom, I quite forgot. Did you want them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked vexed for a moment, but only for a moment. &ldquo;It does not matter.
      I can write. I promised Jackson he should have them this week. Cousin Ann
      has a wonderful show of anemones this year, Aunt Lucy. The square bed in
      the back garden is brilliant with them. We must try them here again next
      year. I don&rsquo;t intend to be satisfied till we have beaten Cousin Ann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says the soil here doesn&rsquo;t suit anemones; they are fanciful flowers,&rdquo;
       returned Miss Merivale. &ldquo;Then you went to Broadhurst, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I just managed it. Old Mrs. Harding was there. She is failing very
      fast, poor old soul. Part of the time she thought I was Cousin James, Aunt
      Lucy. She wanted to know when I heard last from my sister Lydia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale put her cup down with a little clatter. Her hand had begun
      to tremble. &ldquo;You are very much like James, Tom,&rdquo; she said, glancing at the
      portrait that hung on the wainscoted wall just above him, &ldquo;and you get
      more like him every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the portrait of her only brother she was looking at. Tom and Rose
      were her cousin&rsquo;s children, though they called her aunt. She had adopted
      them when Rose was a baby and Tom a sturdy lad of five. Woodcote had been
      their home ever since. Tom had grown up knowing that the estate was to be
      his at Miss Merivale&rsquo;s death. James Merivale had died young, ten years
      before his father; and Lydia, Miss Merivale&rsquo;s only sister, had married
      against her father&rsquo;s wishes, and had been disowned by him. After vainly
      trying to gain his forgiveness, she and her husband emigrated to
      Australia, and for some years nothing was heard of them. Then Lydia wrote
      to her father, telling him that she was a widow, and begging him to send
      her money that she might come home. The stern old man burnt the letter
      without answering it and without showing it to his daughter Lucy, and the
      next news came in a letter written by Lydia to her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had married again, her husband&rsquo;s partner, James Sampson, and had a
      little daughter, whom she had named Rhoda, after her mother. The letter
      asked for money, and Miss Merivale sent what she could, though she had
      little to send, for her father demanded a strict account of all she spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him the letter to read, and he returned it to her without a word;
      but his heart must have relented towards his disobedient daughter at the
      last, for by a codicil to his will it was provided that at Miss Merivale&rsquo;s
      death Woodcote was to pass to Lydia, or, in the event of her not surviving
      her sister, to her daughter Rhoda.
    </p>
    <p>
      But poor Lydia never knew that her father had forgiven her. She died three
      days before him; and when her sister&rsquo;s letter reached Australia, James
      Sampson had broken up his home in Melbourne and started with his little
      daughter for a distant settlement. He never reached the settlement, and
      all Miss Merivale&rsquo;s efforts to trace him proved fruitless. She at last
      accepted the belief of the lawyers that he had lost his way, and, like so
      many other hapless wanderers, had perished in the bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Tom had become dear as a son to her, fears would sometimes rise that
      his claim to Woodcote might one day be disputed; but as the quiet years
      went on these fears ceased to present themselves, and when Pauline
      mentioned Rhoda Sampson the name had gone through her like a knife. She
      tried&mdash;she had been trying ever since&mdash;to tell herself that it
      was impossible it could be James Sampson&rsquo;s child, but the terror had laid
      fast hold of her, and she could not shake it off. It was as James
      Sampson&rsquo;s child she had always thought of her niece. Her heart had refused
      to give her the place Lydia&rsquo;s little girl had a right to claim. She could
      not think of her as Lydia&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had not noticed his aunt&rsquo;s agitation at the mention of her sister&rsquo;s
      name. He went on speaking of his visit to Broadhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They want you to spend a day or two there next week, Rosie. Mr. Powell
      has asked Laura to sing at the concert, and she wants to practise with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose&rsquo;s pretty face clouded over. &ldquo;But I am going to stay with Pauline next
      week. And I wish people wouldn&rsquo;t ask Laura to sing in public. She can&rsquo;t
      sing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to listen to her, though,&rdquo; returned Tom sturdily. &ldquo;We
      aren&rsquo;t all as critical as you, Rosie; and our Parish Room isn&rsquo;t the Albert
      Hall. You had much better go to Broadhurst than to Chelsea. Miss Smythe
      and Miss Desborough live in two cupboards up among the clouds, don&rsquo;t
      they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t quite as bad as that, my dear,&rdquo; broke in Miss Merivale, as she
      saw Rose&rsquo;s vexed expression. &ldquo;I promised that Rose should stay with them
      for a day or two. I thought that if you went up to Joachim&rsquo;s concert you
      might leave Rose behind, and fetch her next day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Aunt Lucy, Pauline said a week!&rdquo; exclaimed Rose in dismay. &ldquo;We could
      do nothing in a day. And we want to do so much. Time always flies so fast
      in London. One <i>lives</i> there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We only vegetate here, eh, Rosie?&rdquo; said Tom in a tone of good-humoured
      banter. &ldquo;Was Wordsworth a vegetable too? He lived in the country, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Rose refused to answer this. &ldquo;Aunt Lucy, I may stay longer than a day,
      may I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, of course. Don&rsquo;t mind Tom&rsquo;s teasing. I must go up to town
      again to-morrow, I find, and I will call at Cadogan Mansions and see Miss
      Smythe for you. And I can get your seeds, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both Rose and Tom stared in surprise at this. &ldquo;Aunt Lucy, you will tire
      yourself out if you go off shopping again to-morrow,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom.
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I must go, my dear. I shall go by train, I think. You shall drive me
      to the station, and I can take a hansom at Victoria. No, you must not come
      with me, Tom. I want to see Mr. Thomson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to find your way to Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn by yourself,&rdquo; said
      Tom teasingly. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let her go alone, can we, Rose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such foolish children,&rdquo; returned Miss Merivale, getting up from
      the table. &ldquo;I have a matter of business to talk over with Mr. Thomson,
      Tom. And I would rather go alone, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with such unwonted decision Tom could say no more. But he was
      both hurt and surprised. Miss Merivale was accustomed to ask his opinion
      on every business matter. He practically managed the estate for her. It
      seemed very strange to him that she should be so bent on going to see Mr.
      Thomson alone. He felt as if he must have proved himself in some way
      unworthy of her confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale saw that he was hurt, though he tried his best to hide it.
      But it was impossible for her to explain. She had determined to be silent
      till she had seen Rhoda Sampson and found out who she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose was as much surprised as Tom at her aunt&rsquo;s determination to go alone
      to London next day. She talked of it to Tom in the drawing-room when Miss
      Merivale had gone up to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it is about her will, do you?&rdquo; she said, in a hushed
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom gave her a look of strong disgust. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything about it.
      But she isn&rsquo;t fit to go by herself. Get her to take Maitland, if she won&rsquo;t
      take one of us. She was looking quite ill this evening, didn&rsquo;t you notice?
      I wouldn&rsquo;t stay away a week, Rosie, if I were you. She misses you
      dreadfully if you are away only a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is so dull here, doing nothing day after day but wait on Aunt
      Lucy, and pick the flowers, and look after the old people in the village,&rdquo;
       said Rose, moved to a sudden burst of confidence. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s different for you,
      Tom. You have your shooting and fishing, and the estate to look after, and
      all the rest of it. But I&rsquo;m at home all day&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where a girl ought to be, my dear,&rdquo; returned Tom good-humouredly.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to pity you. If you are dull, it&rsquo;s your own fault. Laura
      isn&rsquo;t dull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose an oyster is dull,&rdquo; was Rose&rsquo;s disdainful retort. &ldquo;But
      it&rsquo;s no good to talk to you, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say Laura is as clever as you, my dear,&rdquo; returned Tom, with
      undiminished good humour. &ldquo;But it is no good grumbling about your lot.
      Aunt Lucy couldn&rsquo;t do without you, and you wouldn&rsquo;t leave her if you
      could. So what&rsquo;s the use of talking? And as to your being dull, I don&rsquo;t
      believe it. You only imagine you are. That&rsquo;s where your cleverness comes
      in, you see. We stupid people aren&rsquo;t ashamed to be contented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose could not help laughing at this, though she felt very cross. But she
      felt Tom was right in saying that her aunt could not do without her for
      very long. And she told herself sorrowfully that she must give up all hope
      of sharing Pauline&rsquo;s flat when Clare went back to dull captivity at
      Desborough Park. She could not be spared. It seemed doubtful if she would
      be able to persuade her aunt and Tom to let her stay more than a day or
      two when she made her promised visit in the following week.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went up to her aunt&rsquo;s room to bid her good-night, feeling herself a
      martyr, but determined to bear her hard lot with decent cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale was sitting at the old bureau where she kept her most
      private papers. She had been reading over again the letter in which Lydia
      told her of the birth of her little dark-eyed girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many tears had fallen on the yellow pages before she put them away, and
      she turned such a white, worn face to Rose as she entered, Rose felt
      horribly ashamed at having ever thought of sharing Pauline&rsquo;s flat. And the
      good-night embrace she gave Miss Merivale before going into the little
      white room that opened from her aunt&rsquo;s had compunction in it as well as
      warm affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Lucy, do let Tom go with you to-morrow,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;But must you
      go to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must, dear. And I want to go alone,&rdquo; Miss Merivale answered. Then
      she pinched Rose&rsquo;s cheek, trying to speak playfully. &ldquo;You silly children,
      am I not to be trusted to go anywhere alone? I shall start early, and get
      back early. It is business I cannot put off, Rose. Perhaps to-morrow I
      shall be able to tell you all about it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. A VISIT TO KENTISH TOWN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was just before twelve o&rsquo;clock next morning when Miss Merivale reached
      Cadogan Mansions. She told the cabman to wait, and walked slowly up the
      long flights of stone steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half-way up, she met a girl coming down, with light springing steps,
      buttoning a pair of shabby dogskin gloves. Her dress was shabby too, and
      the little black straw hat had seen long service; but Miss Merivale only
      noticed her bonnie face. It brightened the dreary staircase like a gleam
      of sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It never struck her that this was the girl she had come to see. From
      Pauline&rsquo;s words the day before, she had pictured Rhoda Sampson as a very
      different sort of girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flat was at the top of the high buildings, and Miss Merivale was out
      of breath by the time she reached the neat front door with the electric
      bell. She had not long to wait before her ring was answered by Mrs.
      Richards, a thin, careworn woman, who ushered her into the sitting-room
      where Miss Desborough sat at her writing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      She jumped up, with her pen in her hand. &ldquo;Miss Merivale, what a delightful
      surprise! Is Rose with you? I was so sorry to miss you yesterday, but I
      had to go to a committee meeting. I have more work on my hands just now
      than I can do. Would you mind my just finishing this letter for the post?
      It is very important. I shall not be five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale, who had seen Clare running about the garden at Woodcote
      three summers before with her hair flying, was considerably taken aback by
      her extremely &ldquo;grown-up&rdquo; manner. She sat meekly down on the sofa and
      waited for the letter to be finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, it&rsquo;s done!&rdquo; Clare exclaimed, after a moment or two. &ldquo;Now I will
      just give it to Mrs. Richards, and we can have a little talk. Pauline will
      be back in half an hour,&rdquo; She glanced as she spoke at a tiny clock on the
      writing-table. &ldquo;Then after lunch I must rush off to Southwark. I shall
      find a big mothers&rsquo; meeting waiting for me. The women bring their
      needlework, and I talk to them. Last week we considered Food Stuffs in
      reference to young children, and this afternoon I am going to discuss
      Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s Theory of Education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! these sound very difficult subjects for you, my dear,&rdquo; said Miss
      Merivale, trying to repress a laugh as she looked at Clare&rsquo;s serious young
      face. &ldquo;They must need a great deal of preparation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is the worst of it. I haven&rsquo;t time for any study. We workers
      lead very busy lives, Miss Merivale. I am rushing all day from one thing
      to another, feeling all the time that I ought to be doing something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It suggested itself to Miss Merivale that work undertaken in that hurried
      fashion must do more harm than good; but she was too eager to speak of
      Rhoda Sampson to think much of anything else. &ldquo;You have someone to help
      you, Miss Smythe told us yesterday,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Someone who typewrites
      your letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Miss Sampson? Yes, she is an energetic little thing. But she has
      vexed me to-day. I particularly wanted her this afternoon, and she has
      asked for a holiday. Her little cousin is ill, and she wants to take him
      into the country somewhere. She has just gone. You must have met her on
      the stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale started. &ldquo;Yes, I met someone coming down. Was that Miss
      Sampson? Then she is not coming back to-day? I wanted some programmes
      typewritten. Could you give me her address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have it here somewhere. But she will be here on Monday. I will
      speak to her, if you like I shall be glad to get her some work; for after
      next week I shall not want her, though I have not told her so yet. Mother
      is coming home rather sooner than we expected, and I am going back to
      Desborough with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? You will be sorry to give up your work, won&rsquo;t you, my dear?&rdquo;
       asked Miss Merivale mechanically, as she watched Clare turning over her
      address-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother has promised that I shall come back later on and stay with Aunt
      Metcalfe. I shall like that better than this. One gets tired of a flat
      after a time. But here is Miss Sampson&rsquo;s address. Will you write to her,
      or shall I tell her what you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go there now,&rdquo; Miss Merivale said, her hand closing eagerly on the
      slip of paper Clare gave her. &ldquo;She has just come from Australia, Miss
      Smythe said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; they have been in England a few months only. I know nothing more of
      her. But she is a good little thing. Pauline does not like her, but
      Pauline is too critical sometimes. I notice that she is strangely lacking
      in sympathy towards girls of Miss Sampson&rsquo;s class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a long drive from Chelsea to Acacia Road, Kentish Town. Miss
      Merivale knew London very little, though she had lived near it all her
      life, and the dreary, respectable streets she drove through after leaving
      Oxford Street behind her oppressed her even more than Whitechapel had done
      in her one visit to it with Tom, the year before, to see a loan collection
      of pictures. Street after street of blank, drab-faced houses&mdash;dull,
      unsmiling houses! She thought of children growing up there, wan and
      joyless, like plants kept out of the sun. And then two happy-eyed boys
      came running by with their satchels under their arms, while a door opened
      and a woman with a smiling mother-face came out to welcome them. And Miss
      Merivale confessed to herself the mistake she had been making. Where love
      is, even a dull London street has its sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acacia Road was reached at last, and the cab drew up before a small
      bow-windowed house that had a card, &ldquo;Apartments to Let,&rdquo; over the hall
      door. A little servant with a dirty apron and a merry face opened the
      door, and two boys with bright red pinafores came rushing from the
      sitting-room behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sampson wasn&rsquo;t in, but her aunt, Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister, was, the smiling
      servant-maid told Miss Merivale, and led the way into the front
      sitting-room. The boys ran upstairs. Miss Merivale heard them shouting to
      their mother that a lady wanted her, and she sat down on a chair near the
      door, trembling all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was the ordinary lodging-house sitting-room; but though there was
      a litter of toys on the worn carpet, it had evidently been carefully swept
      and dusted that morning, and there was a brown jug filled with fresh
      daffodils on the centre table. On the side table near Miss Merivale there
      was a pile of books. She looked at the titles as she waited for a step on
      the stairs&mdash;<i>The Civil Service Geography, Hamblin Smith&rsquo;s
      Arithmetic</i>, one or two French Readers, a novel by George MacDonald,
      and a worn edition of Longfellow&rsquo;s Poems. Miss Merivale wondered if they
      all belonged to Rhoda.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not kept waiting very long. Almost before she had finished looking
      at the books she heard someone coming down the stairs, and the door opened
      to admit a tall, angular woman, whose brown hair was thickly streaked with
      grey. Miss Merivale found herself unable to begin at once to make the
      inquiries she had come to make, and fell back on the programmes she wanted
      typewritten. Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister eagerly promised that Rhoda would undertake
      the work. She had not a typewriter of her own, but a friend would lend the
      use of hers, and Miss Merivale might rely on the work being done
      punctually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very kind of Miss Desborough to recommend Rhoda,&rdquo; she said in her
      anxious voice. &ldquo;It is difficult to get work in London, we find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have lately come from Australia, have you not?&rdquo; asked Miss Merivale
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister was too simple-minded to discern the profound agitation
      that lay beneath Miss Merivale&rsquo;s quiet manner. And the kind voice and
      kind, gentle face of her visitor led her to be more confidential than was
      her wont with strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we came back just before Christmas. When my husband died, I felt I
      must come home. My brothers offered to help me with the boys. Rhoda has
      taken the youngest down to one of his uncles to-day. But it&rsquo;s only in
      Essex; she will be back to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said the last words hurriedly, as if afraid of wearying her visitor.
      She little knew how Miss Merivale was hanging on her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your niece must be a great comfort to you,&rdquo; Miss Merivale said, after a
      moment&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;Has she always lived with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As good as always. She wasn&rsquo;t five when we had her first. Her father was
      our nearest neighbour; we were living up in the hills then, fifty miles
      from a town. She used to stay with us for days together while her father
      went off after cattle. And when he died we brought her home for good. I
      haven&rsquo;t a girl of my own, but I&rsquo;ve never known what it is to miss one.
      Rhoda&rsquo;s no kith or kin to us, but she has been a daughter to me, all the
      same, and a sister to the boys. We&rsquo;ve had a hard fight since we came home,
      for my brothers have been unfortunate lately, and are not able to help us
      as they wanted to; but Rhoda hasn&rsquo;t lost heart for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister had been drawn into making this long speech by the eager
      look of interest she saw in Miss Merivale&rsquo;s face; but now she stopped
      short, her pale face flushing a little. She felt afraid lest Miss Merivale
      might think she was asking for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I suppose she had no relatives of her own?&rdquo; asked Miss Merivale,
      after a pause, in which she had been struggling for her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had some on her mother&rsquo;s side. I never heard their names. But her
      father seemed certain that they would be unkind to the child, and he was
      thankful when we promised to keep her. He was a queer, silent sort of man.
      We never knew much about him, except that he had lived in Adelaide. But he
      was mother and father both to Rhoda. He was just wrapped up in her. It was
      a pretty sight to see them together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were many questions Miss Merivale would have liked to ask, but she
      had not the courage to. She was afraid of betraying herself. She no longer
      felt any doubt about Rhoda&rsquo;s parentage. James Sampson had not perished in
      the bush, but had hidden himself in that lonely spot up among the hills,
      where either no news of the will had reached him, or he had deliberately
      refrained from communicating with England. Perhaps he thought that his
      girl would be happier with the kind M&rsquo;Alisters than with her rich English
      relatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most probable supposition was that he had never heard of the will.
      Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister had said that they were living fifty miles from a town. How
      easily it might have happened that the advertisements they put in the
      Melbourne papers had never been seen by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she could she got away, after arranging that Rhoda should bring
      the programmes to Woodcote one day in the following week, so that she
      might talk over with her the details of some other work she wanted done.
      Miss Merivale marvelled at herself for the calmness with which she settled
      all this.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when once she was in the cab her strength left her. After telling the
      man to drive her to Victoria, she sank back faint and trembling. The
      alternatives that lay before her seemed equally impossible. If Rhoda was
      Lydia&rsquo;s child, her own niece, her successor to Woodcote, how could she
      leave her unacknowledged? How could she be silent about the discovery she
      had made, even for a day? And as Miss Merivale thought this she stretched
      her hand to the check-string, determining to drive at once to Lincoln&rsquo;s
      Inn to see her lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her hand dropped at her side. All his life Tom had thought of Woodcote
      as his inheritance; every stone, every blade of grass, was dear to him. He
      would have to leave it, to go out into the world to fight for his living.
      How could she let him go? If she was silent, no one would be likely to
      guess that Rhoda was Lydia&rsquo;s child. She was not mentioned by name in the
      will. And she should not suffer. Ways and means of providing for her could
      be found. But she could not have Woodcote. That was Tom&rsquo;s. It would break
      Tom&rsquo;s heart to give it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Miss Merivale thought of Tom her heart grew hard against Rhoda. She who
      had never hated anyone felt herself in danger of hating Lydia&rsquo;s little
      girl. Tears burst from her eyes and streamed down her cheeks. She did not
      think of wiping them away. She sat with her hands clasped on her lap,
      staring miserably in front of her. What she was to do she did not know.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. TOM AND RHODA MEET.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the day of the Joachim concert Tom and Rose went up to London soon
      after breakfast. Tom was not going to the concert. After taking Rose to
      Cadogan Mansions he meant to hurry back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was anxious about his aunt. She had been so unlike herself during the
      last few days, he feared she must be ill. And he felt sure he must have
      offended her in some way, for she had seemed anxious to avoid him, and he
      had hardly spoken to her since she came back from London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did she think he was taking too much on himself? He had got into the habit
      lately of settling matters of minor importance without consulting her, so
      as to save her trouble. Perhaps he had annoyed her by doing so. At any
      rate, he would ask her if this was so. Tom&rsquo;s nature was so simple and
      straightforward that this was the natural course for him to take. He
      believed half the difficulties of life arose from the want of a little
      plain speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale had said little about her journey to town. She left Tom and
      Rose under the impression that she had called at the lawyer&rsquo;s, and it was
      not till the next day that she casually mentioned her visit to Mrs.
      M&rsquo;Alister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have asked Miss Sampson to come and see me,&rdquo; she added, after telling
      them that Rhoda was to do some typewriting for her. &ldquo;I am interested in
      her, Rose. Did you know that poor Lydia&rsquo;s second husband was named
      Sampson? It is not at all certain that this girl is of the same family, as
      she comes from quite a different part of Australia. But I should like to
      see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale had had this speech carefully prepared ever since she came
      home, and she uttered it so carelessly that neither Rose nor Tom suspected
      how her heart beat as she said it. Their cousin Lydia was a faint, shadowy
      figure to them, and the suggestion that Miss Sampson might prove to be
      related to her husband aroused no interest in their minds. Tom never
      thought of it again till Rose mentioned Miss Sampson as they were
      travelling up to Victoria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish Aunt Lucy hadn&rsquo;t taken her up like this,&rdquo; she said impatiently.
      &ldquo;Pauline will be vexed, for she advised Aunt Lucy to have nothing to do
      with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if she is our cousin,&rdquo; suggested Tom, with a twinkle in his blue
      eyes, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think we are bound to patronise our relations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could she be our cousin? Don&rsquo;t be so foolish, Tom,&rdquo; Rose answered
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A family connection, then,&rdquo; returned Tom. &ldquo;But perhaps you had better not
      mention the possibility to Miss Smythe. It would shock her too much. All
      her relations are in Debrett, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose looked doubtfully at him. &ldquo;I never know whether you like Pauline or
      not, Tom,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I am sure you never heard her boast of her
      relations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I never did, my dear; but I have somehow gathered the fact that they
      are very fine people indeed. I always feel I ought to be ashamed that we
      did not come over at the Conquest when I am talking to Miss Smythe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are laughing at her,&rdquo; returned Rose, with some indignation in her
      voice. &ldquo;I believe you are always laughing at her, Tom. And it is just
      because she is clever. Men always like stupid girls best, who think
      everything they say is wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Tom laughed outright. &ldquo;There is one clever little girl I am very
      fond of,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it is going to be dull at Woodcote without her.
      When will you come back, Rosie? Don&rsquo;t stay very long. I am sure Aunt Lucy
      is not well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must stay till Thursday. Pauline and Clare are going to have a musical
      At Home on Thursday. But I will come back on Friday, Tom. I must, I
      suppose.&rdquo; And Rose tried to suppress a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really want to stay longer?&rdquo; said Tom, with a wondering look at
      her. &ldquo;I daresay Laura would spend a day or two with Aunt Lucy. I don&rsquo;t
      think she ought to be alone, Rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laura fidgets Aunt Lucy to death,&rdquo; Rose answered quickly. &ldquo;You know she
      does, Tom. Of course I shall come back on Friday. I promised Aunt Lucy I
      would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Tom and Rose were talking thus, Miss Merivale was waiting anxiously
      for Rhoda. She had arranged that she should come to Woodcote that morning
      while Tom and Rose were away. The station was only half a mile from the
      house, and she did not send to meet her; but she sat by the drawing-room
      window, looking with painful eagerness down the drive for the first
      glimpse of the slim figure she remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock when Rhoda came up the quiet country road and
      turned in at the iron gates. It was a delightful day, the first real day
      of spring. Though no leaves were yet on the trees, ruddy brown buds just
      ready for bursting clothed every branch. And the grass along the hedges
      was starred with celandines and daisies, while yellow catkins sprinkled
      the bushes above them. A blackbird was singing loudly as Rhoda passed the
      big chestnut trees by the gate, and a squirrel darted down from a fir and
      scurried across the drive to hide himself in the little wood. Rhoda waited
      a moment, hoping for another glimpse of the bright-eyed little fellow. She
      was a child still in her delight in small animals, and this visit to
      Woodcote was a great treat to her. She loved the country as only
      country-bred people forced to live in a big town can love it. And this
      sweet English countryside, with its breezy uplands and smiling pastures,
      seemed more beautiful to her than even her dear Australia.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a breath of delighted admiration when she came out on the lawn
      and saw the old house with its beds of tulips before it flaming in the
      sun. It was such a house as she had read of but had never seen, a haunt of
      ancient peace, time-worn, yet smiling still, its walls mellowed by the
      sunshine of many a hundred summers. She would have stood a moment to
      notice the delightful lines the gables made against the sky, but a figure
      at one of the deep, narrow-paned windows to the right of the porch caught
      her attention, and remembering that she had come on sober business, she
      walked briskly up to the heavy iron-studded door within the porch and
      pulled the twisted bell rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      By Miss Merivale&rsquo;s orders she was shown into the library, a delightful
      room looking out on the garden at the back of the house. She had ample
      time to notice what a dear old garden it was, for Miss Merivale kept her
      waiting quite a quarter of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once Miss Merivale went across the narrow hall and put her hand
      on the door, and then went back to the drawing-room, finding her courage
      fail her. And when at last she entered, she was so deadly pale, Rhoda lost
      all her nervousness in pity for her; she felt sure that she must be ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that will do very nicely,&rdquo; Miss Merivale said, after giving the
      typewritten programmes a cursory glance and pushing them from her. Her
      eyes went back to Rhoda&rsquo;s face. She saw now that the fleeting glimpse she
      had got of her on the staircase had somewhat deceived her. Rhoda was not
      as pretty as she had thought. Her mouth was a little too wide, and her
      nose had too blunt a tip for beauty. But it was a charming face,
      nevertheless, full of heart-sunshine; and the dark brown, darkly-fringed
      eyes would have redeemed a plainer face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale remembered with a sharp pang how Lydia had written of her
      dark-eyed girl. She spoke of her sister, after a moment or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has struck me that your father might have been related to her second
      husband,&rdquo; she said. She had determined after leaving Acacia Road to
      mention this as possible both to Rhoda and to Tom and Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people knew that Lydia had been Mrs. Sampson when she died, though
      Miss Merivale believed that she herself was the only person who was aware
      that her child had been named Rhoda.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she soon found that Rhoda knew very little of her father. She had
      lived so long with the M&rsquo;Alisters that she had come to identify herself
      with them, and had never desired to learn more of her own people. She
      could scarcely remember her father, and could not remember his Christian
      name. &ldquo;J. Sampson is written in my little Bible,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is the
      only book I have which belonged to him. Our house was burnt down when I
      was about two years old, and all his books and papers were burnt with it.
      Uncle Tom and Mr. Harding used to call him Jack, I have heard Aunt Mary
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was Mr. Harding?&rdquo; asked Miss Merivale quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was father&rsquo;s partner for a little while. I don&rsquo;t remember him at all.
      He is a rich man now, and lives in Adelaide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father came from Adelaide, Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister told me. My sister lived
      in Melbourne. Then you can tell me nothing else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda hesitated a moment. Miss Merivale&rsquo;s voice had been cold and
      constrained, but there was a beseeching eagerness in her glance. She
      unclasped a little locket from her watch-chain and passed it across the
      table. &ldquo;That and my little Bible is all I have. It must have been my
      mother&rsquo;s, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale caught up the little locket with trembling fingers. She rose
      and went to the window, and stood with her back to Rhoda, apparently
      examining it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her eyes were too full of tears for her to see it plainly. She knew
      the little locket well. She herself had given it to Lydia one birthday. It
      was her own hair under the glass, with the ring of tiny pearls round it.
      All doubt vanished from her mind. She was certain now that Rhoda was her
      niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came back to the side of the table where Rhoda was sitting, and put
      her hand on her shoulder as she gave her back the locket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for letting me see it, my dear,&rdquo; she said in a voice that
      trembled a good deal in spite of the intense effort she was making to hide
      her agitation. &ldquo;And now can you make yourself happy in the garden for a
      little while? I want you to stay to luncheon with me. I will talk to you
      afterwards of the work I want you to do for me. And you must tell me more
      about yourself. Try and think of me as a friend, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried away, not trusting herself to say more just then, and Rhoda
      gladly went into the garden. Her heart was very light as she wandered up
      and down the turf paths. Miss Merivale&rsquo;s sudden interest in her and the
      great kindness with which she spoke when she gave her back the locket did
      not surprise her as it might have surprised a girl more versed in the
      world&rsquo;s ways. But she was eagerly grateful. She felt it would be easy to
      tell Miss Merivale of the hard struggle she and Aunt Mary had had to keep
      the younger boys at school and pay the premium for Ned&rsquo;s apprenticeship to
      that big engineering firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sure Miss Merivale would not suppose she wanted money help. She
      had talked of giving her work, and it was work that Rhoda was pining for.
      Her strong young hands and willing brain were eager to be employed to the
      utmost.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a hard blow to hear that she was to lose her post with Miss
      Desborough. But perhaps Miss Merivale would be able to help her to get
      something better. If she could earn a pound a week, there would be no need
      for Aunt Mary to tire her eyes out over that weary needlework. A pound a
      week would be riches added to the weekly wages Ned brought home and the
      interest from the money they had laid by for a rainy day. There would be
      no need for Aunt Mary to work for those hard shop-people any more. And
      Rhoda&rsquo;s eyes sparkled as she thought of packing up the last parcel of fine
      needle-work and taking it back with the message that no more was wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been in the garden about ten minutes when Tom, after vainly
      looking for his aunt in the house, came through the glass door of the
      library to seek for her out of doors. It startled him for a moment to see
      a strange young lady in the garden, but before she turned and saw him he
      had remembered who she must be, and he went forward quickly, taking off
      his hat, to introduce himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      No touch of awkwardness marred their first words to each other. Tom&rsquo;s
      frank face and pleasant greeting won Rhoda&rsquo;s confidence at once, and in a
      few moments they were chatting like old acquaintances. Tom soon found that
      she loved a garden as much as he did, though this was the first large
      English garden she had seen. He was eagerly questioning her about
      Australian flowers when Miss Merivale entered the library and caught sight
      of them through the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colour flowed into her pale face as she watched them talking to each
      other. For the first time she saw how Woodcote might be Tom&rsquo;s and yet be
      Rhoda&rsquo;s too.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. &ldquo;A MERRY HEART GOES ALL THE WAY.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Dusk had fallen before Rhoda got back to Acacia Road. The omnibus stopped
      at the corner, and as she went down the dreary street carrying a big bunch
      of flowers from the old garden, she might have come straight from Arcady,
      so bright her face was. Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister was watching for her from the
      window with the boys, and they were all at the door to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I was getting anxious about you,&rdquo; said Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister, as they
      went into the sitting-room, Rhoda holding little Willie in her arms. &ldquo;You
      are much later than you expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Merivale begged me to stay. Oh, Aunt Mary, she has been so kind! But
      I will tell you all about it presently. How tired you look, Aunt Mary!
      Jack and Willie, I hope you have been good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have been very good,&rdquo; said Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister hastily. &ldquo;I have been
      trying to get my work finished. Give me your hat and jacket, darling; Jack
      shall take them upstairs for you. You have had a long day. How beautiful
      those flowers are! They scent the room already. English flowers are
      sweeter than our flowers used to be. But we had a lovely garden, hadn&rsquo;t
      we?&rdquo; She was speaking very nervously, and she kissed Rhoda again as she
      took her hat and jacket from her. &ldquo;I am so glad Miss Merivale was so kind,
      dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she was wonderfully kind. And she has given me some more programmes
      to do. I am to take them to her on Thursday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be another nice change for you, dear. You look all the better
      for a breath of country air,&rdquo; was Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister&rsquo;s nervously-spoken
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle James says we are all to live in the country with him,&rdquo; broke in
      Jack, who had been watching for an opportunity to make his voice heard.
      &ldquo;And we shall have cream every day, and see the pigs fed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle James?&rdquo; said Rhoda, looking at Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister. A little shadow had
      fallen on her face. Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister&rsquo;s elder brother had been the only
      person who had ever made her feel that she was an outsider and had no real
      claim to the place she held in the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister&rsquo;s anxious face had clouded over too. &ldquo;My dear, I did not
      want to speak of it till after tea. James is coming in again this evening,
      when Ned is home. Jack and Willie, run and ask Mrs. Ellis if the kettle is
      boiling yet. Rhoda will want some tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had tea before I came away,&rdquo; Rhoda said, as the boys ran off. &ldquo;When did
      Uncle James come, Aunt Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This afternoon, dear. He got to London last night. And he went down to
      the works this morning, and saw Ned and Mr. Howard. Oh, Rhoda, they want
      Ned to go to Plymouth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda looked at her aunt. She understood now what those new lines of
      anxiety in her face meant which she had noticed the moment she came in.
      &ldquo;To Plymouth, Aunt Mary? But that is a long way off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have a branch there, and they want Ned to go. James says it is a
      splendid thing for him. And he wants me to go down there and live with
      him, Rhoda. His farm is only three miles from Plymouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not look at Rhoda as she spoke, but kept fingering the tablecloth
      nervously, with her eyes cast down. For a few seconds Rhoda was silent.
      Then her voice was very cheerful. &ldquo;Why, you will be quite close to Ned,
      Aunt Mary. And the country air will be so good for the boys. I think it is
      a splendid plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister gave her a piteous glance. &ldquo;If only you could go too, Rhoda
      darling. But James says&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I get work in the country, Aunt Mary? And Miss Merivale has
      promised that she will get me plenty of work.&rdquo; Rhoda&rsquo;s lips quivered a
      little as she thought of her day-dreams as she came home&mdash;how if she
      got plenty of work they might take a little house and have a little garden
      of their own. But she went bravely on. &ldquo;It would be foolish of me to think
      of leaving London, Aunt Mary. And of course you must go with Ned. Is he
      pleased about it? They must think a good deal of him to promote him like
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is a promotion,&rdquo; said the mother eagerly. She was very fond of
      Rhoda, but her eldest boy was her heart&rsquo;s darling. &ldquo;James said Mr. Howard
      spoke so highly of him. And James is very anxious I should go to Coombe.
      His old housekeeper is leaving him, and he wants me. If only&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rhoda again interrupted her. She knew perfectly well how reasonably
      and firmly the shrewd, hard-headed farmer had spoken that afternoon. He
      was both anxious and willing that his sister and her boys should make
      their home with him, but he did not want her. He considered her old enough
      to fight the battle of life for herself. And she was determined that her
      aunt should not guess how hard the parting would be to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a delightful plan, Aunt Mary. You would not have come to London if
      Ned wasn&rsquo;t here. I know how you have hated it. And you must not trouble
      about me. There are heaps of places now where girls can live comfortably
      for very little. I will ask Miss Desborough to-morrow. And if I can pass
      the Post Office examination, I might get appointed to Plymouth. Aunt Mary,
      don&rsquo;t cry. I can&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t feel it as I shall,&rdquo; sobbed Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister, without looking up.
      &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t let Ned go to Plymouth alone, Rhoda. I couldn&rsquo;t be parted
      from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Rhoda answered cheerily. She was glad her aunt did not
      look up, for she knew her face had turned very white, and slow hot tears
      had forced themselves into her eyes. But her voice was cheery. &ldquo;And you
      will be quite close to him at Coombe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be able to live with us. There is a station quite close,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister, drying her tears. Now that Rhoda seemed to bear the news
      so well, she was able to think of the bright side of things. &ldquo;And you must
      spend a long month with us in the summer, Rhoda darling. James means to
      insist on that. He does mean to be kind, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure he does. And when he hears about Miss Merivale he will make you
      see that it would be foolish of me to think of leaving London. But here
      comes the tea at last. I will run up and wash my hands first. Don&rsquo;t wait
      for me, Aunt Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one could have guessed, when Rhoda came down, with her hair freshly
      done, and a new pink ribbon round the neck of her brown dress, what bitter
      tears she had been shedding upstairs. And when Mr. Price came in, he was
      pleasantly surprised at the sensible view she took of things, and his
      invitation to her to spend the August holidays at Coombe was far heartier
      than Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister had dared to hope for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will be able to run down to Leyton for a Sunday every now and
      then,&rdquo; he said, regarding her approvingly out of his hard grey eyes.
      &ldquo;Mary, here, seems to think you&rsquo;re a baby still, but I know better. Girls
      aren&rsquo;t what they used to be, Mary&mdash;silly creatures who couldn&rsquo;t look
      after themselves. They don&rsquo;t want to stay at home by the chimney corner
      all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to work,&rdquo; said Rhoda, speaking rather proudly. She could have
      added that she might have got work at Plymouth and come home every night,
      as Ned was going to do, but she knew that it would be no use to say it. He
      had plainly made up his mind that she must shift for herself. And the only
      excuse she could make for him was that he did not know how hard it was for
      her to be suddenly deprived of a home. Shabby and uncomfortable as their
      lodgings were, not even beautiful Woodcote could have been a dearer home.
      And a deadly chill seized her heart as she thought of living alone or with
      strangers. Rhoda was a thorough woman in her need of a home to fill her
      life. She had never felt Rose&rsquo;s desire to be free from home ties; she
      could not have understood it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rhoda means to ask Miss Desborough&rsquo;s advice, James,&rdquo; said Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister,
      putting down her sewing. &ldquo;She knows a great many girls who get their
      living in London and board out somewhere. I shan&rsquo;t feel happy till I see
      Rhoda comfortably settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll manage that for her,&rdquo; returned the farmer briskly. &ldquo;And now
      this Miss Merivale has taken her up she&rsquo;ll get plenty of work, never
      fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would it do for you to live with Miss Smythe?&rdquo; suggested Mrs.
      M&rsquo;Alister, looking anxiously at Rhoda. &ldquo;Now Miss Desborough is going away,
      she will want somebody, won&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile broke over Rhoda&rsquo;s face. She had never spoken of Pauline&rsquo;s
      contemptuous rudeness to her aunt. She had felt too indifferent to her to
      be hurt by her behaviour; and since her visit to Leyton, the week before,
      she had a special reason for being amused at it. But this she had not
      mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Smythe would think me very bold if I suggested living with her, Aunt
      Mary,&rdquo; she said, in a voice that had a ripple of laughter in it. &ldquo;But
      don&rsquo;t be anxious about me. I can stay here with Mrs. Ellis if I can&rsquo;t hear
      of anything I like better. But I will speak to Miss Desborough to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As it happened, however, Rhoda did not see Clare next day. When she
      arrived at the flat, she found that Lady Desborough had reached town the
      day before, and had taken her daughter for a day&rsquo;s shopping with her,
      preparatory to their journey into Lincolnshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Rose who told Rhoda this. Mrs. Richards had gone out to buy some
      chops for dinner, and Rose opened the door. Rhoda thought her the
      prettiest creature she had ever seen in her life. She had a blue dress on
      and a white cooking apron, and her yellow hair was brushed loosely back
      from her face and fastened in a loose knot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Desborough has left some letters for you to answer,&rdquo; she said to
      Rhoda pleasantly. &ldquo;Can you do them at the side table? I am cooking in the
      sitting-room this morning. It was so hot in the kitchen. Miss Smythe will
      be in presently. She has a message for you from Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was rather difficult to work at the side table, which was small and
      decidedly rickety; but Rhoda made no objection. She found her eyes
      wandering now and then to Rose, who had gone back to her pastry, and was
      spending many puzzled glances on the cookery book that was propped open
      before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to write a cookery book one day,&rdquo; she exclaimed presently, in a
      tone of deep disgust. &ldquo;And I mean to use simple language, and explain
      everything. I can&rsquo;t understand this book a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda was on the point of offering her help, when the door was hastily
      opened and Pauline came in, with a bunch of daffodils in her hand. She
      raised her eyebrows at the sight of the pastry board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling Rose! Suppose Lady Desborough were to come back with Clare,
      what would she think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so hot in the kitchen, Pauline,&rdquo; Rose answered meekly. &ldquo;And I do
      so want to learn how to cook. Mrs. Richards&rsquo; pastry is like leather. Just
      look here. This book says&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pauline laughingly put it from her. &ldquo;My dear child, it is worse than
      Greek to me. And I really do object to see lumps of raw dough about.
      Please take them away. I never like to think of my food till I see it on
      the table. Good-morning, Miss Sampson. When you have finished those
      letters you will not be required any more. I will pay you before you go.
      Miss Desborough has gone out with Lady Desborough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare had left a kind message for Rhoda, and when Pauline went into the
      next room to take off her hat, Rose hastened to give it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was so sorry not to be here to say good-bye to you, Miss Sampson. She
      feels that you have been such a help to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda had listened to Pauline with a smile faintly lurking at the corner
      of her firm lips, but now the smile flashed brightly out at Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been very pleasant work,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am sorry it is over. But
      your aunt has promised me some more work, Miss Merivale. I am to go down
      to Woodcote again on Thursday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose was surprised, and she could not help showing it. &ldquo;You went
      yesterday, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said rather stiffly. &ldquo;It is a long way for you
      to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to go,&rdquo; Rhoda answered. She did not tell Rose she had
      spent the day at Woodcote; something in Rose&rsquo;s manner checked her. But she
      did not begin her writing at once. Rose had taken up the cookery book
      again, and was bending puzzled brows over it. Rhoda watched her for a
      moment, her eyes full of admiration. Miss Desborough was pretty, but there
      was not a soft line in her face. Rose looked a child still for all her
      womanly height. Rhoda said to herself that she must be much younger than
      her brother. It was easy to see that they were brother and sister. Rose
      had just the same straight brow she had noticed in him yesterday, and her
      eyebrows, like his, were a shade or two darker than her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you let me see if I could help you, Miss Merivale?&rdquo; Rhoda said,
      after a moment. &ldquo;I did all the cooking at home before we came to England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Rose shut up her book. &ldquo;Pauline will scold again if I don&rsquo;t carry all
      this away,&rdquo; she said, with a laugh. &ldquo;And I mean to have some cookery
      lessons, if I can get them. But Woodcote is so far from everywhere. It is
      like being buried alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda, who had known what it was to live for years fifty miles from a
      town, did not know how to answer this. And Rose, angry with herself for
      saying so much to Miss Sampson, caught up the pastry board and rolling-pin
      and retreated to the kitchen. She came back in a few moments with her
      apron off, and found Rhoda busy at work, and Pauline in a low chair by the
      fire with her hands clasped round her knees. Pauline had changed her
      outdoor dress for an odd, picturesque frock of sage green Liberty serge,
      touched with yellow. She had fastened some daffodils in her belt, and
      looked like an aesthetic picture of Spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrange my daffodils for me, there is a good little Rose,&rdquo; she said,
      smiling lazily at Rose as she entered. &ldquo;The brown pots, not the blue ones.
      Now Clare is going to her native fens, I mean this room to be a thing of
      beauty and a joy for ever. How good it will be to get rid of the click of
      that typewriter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that to Clare,&rdquo; laughed Rose, as she brought the brown pots to
      the table. &ldquo;She was telling me this morning it was the thing she would
      miss most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline lifted her dark eyebrows. &ldquo;Did she really say that? But it is
      exactly like Clare; she is more a machine herself than a human being. I
      was very fond of her once, but I have found her trying to live with. They
      say you never know a woman till you have lived six months with her. Don&rsquo;t
      put too many daffodils in one pot, my Rose; they want plenty of room to
      show themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda had finished the work Clare had left for her. She carefully put her
      papers together, and rose from the table. Pauline looked carelessly round
      at her. &ldquo;Ah, are you going, Miss Sampson? Here is the money Miss
      Desborough left for you. Just write a receipt and leave it on the table,
      please. You understand that you are not wanted any more, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew this was to be my last day, thank you,&rdquo; said Rhoda composedly. She
      smiled to herself as she wrote her receipt. She half thought of mentioning
      her visit to Leyton, but she refrained. There was not a touch of
      spitefulness in Rhoda&rsquo;s nature, and she had no wish to humiliate Pauline;
      but the humorous side of the situation was thoroughly enjoyed by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose went on arranging her flowers in silence for a minute or two after
      Rhoda went away; then she spoke rather constrainedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you dislike poor Miss Sampson so, Pauline? Do you know that you
      were quite unkind to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I? It is necessary to keep that sort of girl at arm&rsquo;s length; she
      would become intolerable if you didn&rsquo;t. Thank goodness, we have seen the
      last of her. Now, come and sit down here and have a talk. What shall we do
      this afternoon, Rose? Only two more days! What do you want to do most?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare and Lady Desborough are coming back to tea,&rdquo; suggested Rose, with a
      laugh. &ldquo;You are not very hospitable, Pauline. And to-morrow we shall be
      busy all day. My time will soon be over, won&rsquo;t it? Do you know, Aunt Lucy
      has asked Miss Sampson down to Woodcote again to-morrow, Pauline? I wonder
      if she has found out that she is related to Cousin Lydia&rsquo;s husband. I
      don&rsquo;t see what Aunt Lucy can want her for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor relations are a great nuisance,&rdquo; said Pauline sharply. &ldquo;It is
      foolish of your aunt to have anything to do with her. But don&rsquo;t let us
      talk of Sampson, Rosie; let us talk of ourselves. Suppose for a moment
      that you were going to stay with me through the summer, just let us plan
      what we would do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be too tantalising, Pauline. I shall spend the summer at
      Woodcote. I know exactly what I shall be doing every hour of the day, and
      every day of the week, and every week of the month. But don&rsquo;t let us talk
      of it. Let us talk of the concert last night. Wasn&rsquo;t it wonderful? I wish
      Tom had been there; he would have understood better why Laura&rsquo;s singing
      irritates me. Pauline, I must get some good music lessons somehow. Do
      speak to Aunt Lucy about it on Friday. You are quite right; I am wasting
      my time as it is.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. PAULINE&rsquo;S DIPLOMACY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Rhoda got home that morning, she found that Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister had
      already begun to pack. Ned was to go to Plymouth almost at once, and Mr.
      Price was anxious that his sister and the younger boys should return with
      him on the following Saturday. Little Hugh was to stay at Leyton for the
      present; Rhoda was to bring him down when she came for her holiday in
      August.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister did not guess how hard Rhoda found it to be cheerful as she
      helped with the packing. A great load was lifted off her heart by the
      ready way in which the girl had acquiesced in the new arrangements. Much
      as it grieved her to part with Rhoda, she could not help looking forward
      with delight to going back to the dear old farmhouse in which her
      childhood had been spent. And Rhoda understood exactly how she felt. There
      was no bitterness in her heart; but, brave and cheery as she was, she
      dreaded to think of the lonely days that lay before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not go down to Woodcote till Thursday afternoon. Miss Merivale had
      asked her to come early and spend the day, but she had written to explain
      how it was that she could not spare the time; her aunt wanted her help in
      packing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old house looked more beautiful and peaceful than ever, steeped in the
      golden afternoon sunlight. Rhoda thought with a thrill of wonder of Rose&rsquo;s
      words about her home. How could she have spoken so!
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale was in the library, with all the windows open to the garden.
      Rhoda was tremulously surprised at her greeting. She kissed her, and even
      when they sat down she did not leave her hand go, but held it tight,
      looking anxiously at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to tell me more about your aunt,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I did not quite
      understand your letter. You are not going to Devonshire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; I am going on with my work here,&rdquo; Rhoda said hastily. And after a
      pause she added, impelled by the yearning kindness in Miss Merivale&rsquo;s
      eyes, &ldquo;Mr. Price wishes me to stay here. It is not as if I was his own
      niece, you see. And I am nearly twenty; I am quite able to earn my own
      living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale dropped her hand suddenly, and rose and went to the window.
      The quiver in Rhoda&rsquo;s voice was more than she could bear. She spoke
      without turning round. &ldquo;I see they are carrying the tea into the garden.
      Let us go out. I thought it would be pleasanter to have it out of doors.
      And afterwards you shall tell me what you mean to do. I should like&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But she checked herself. She wanted to say that she would like Rhoda to
      come to Woodcote; but she saw how strange such a wish would seem, both to
      Rhoda and to Tom and Rose. She must wait a little. She must content
      herself with helping her in other ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had been obliged to go to Guilford that day on farm business; but
      somehow he had managed to get back early, and he strolled into the garden
      just as they sat down to tea, not looking in the least as if he had just
      ridden twelve miles at headlong speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint smile crossed Miss Merivale&rsquo;s pale face as she saw him. It was
      what she had been hoping for.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left the talk during tea-time to him and Rhoda, who had plenty to say
      to each other. They were both enthusiasts about a garden, and found it
      intensely interesting to compare notes. After tea, Tom was eager to show
      Rhoda some white violets in the wood close by. He found she had never seen
      any.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went off together, and Miss Merivale could hear their eager, happy
      voices as they searched about the wood looking for the violets, just like
      two children. She leant back in her chair, closing her eyes. For the
      moment the ache at her heart was stilled. She was hoping that all might
      yet come right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda went home that evening feeling like a different creature. Mrs.
      M&rsquo;Alister had a jealous pang or two as she listened to her account of the
      happy time she had had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you trust too much to her promises, child,&rdquo; she said anxiously.
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s taken a sudden fancy to you, that&rsquo;s clear enough; but it mightn&rsquo;t
      last. She might take a fancy to somebody else next week, and forget all
      about you. I have heard of people like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Miss Merivale is a bit like that,&rdquo; returned Rhoda stoutly.
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she a sweet, kind face, Aunt Mary? I wish she didn&rsquo;t look so ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rest your hopes on her too much,&rdquo; repeated Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister, shaking
      her head gloomily. &ldquo;James will be in again to-night, and you will hear
      what he says. He has heard of a firm that wants a lady-clerk. We think
      you&rsquo;d better try for it, Rhoda. I&rsquo;d like to see you settled before we go
      away. I&rsquo;ve been wishing and wishing this afternoon that you could go with
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say that to Mr. Price, Aunt Mary,&rdquo; Rhoda said quickly. &ldquo;You
      know how it vexes him. And he is very kind. You heard him tell me that I
      was to ask him for any money I wanted. But I don&rsquo;t think I shall want any.
      Miss Merivale said again this afternoon that she would be able to get me
      as much work as I could do. She is going to write to me on Monday. I am
      quite sure she meant it. And I don&rsquo;t want to try for work in an office if
      I can help it. I should feel in prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale had spoken very vaguely of the work she was going to give
      Rhoda. She had, in truth, made up her mind that Rhoda must come to
      Woodcote. She was only waiting till Rose came home to arrange it. However
      much she surprised Rose and Tom, however difficult it would be to explain
      why she wanted Rhoda, Rhoda must come to her. She could not leave Lydia&rsquo;s
      girl alone in London. And Tom&rsquo;s surprise, at least, would have no element
      of annoyance in it. It was quite plain already that Rhoda&rsquo;s company was
      delightful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been arranged that Tom should go and fetch his sister on Friday,
      but by the first post on Friday morning Miss Merivale got a letter from
      Rose, saying that Pauline would return with her that afternoon, and that
      there was no need for Tom to come to London. It was at Pauline&rsquo;s
      instigation Rose had written the letter. Those few charmed days in the
      little flat had made Rose more passionately desirous than ever to get away
      from Woodcote, and Pauline had suggested that she should go home with Rose
      and beg her aunt to allow her to pay a longer visit a little later in the
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May is the best month of the year in London, Rose. You shall spend May
      with me. The flat will have to be given up then, if I cannot get anyone to
      share it with me. Lady Desborough only took it till the end of April. But
      we will have a lovely May together. I am sure your aunt will not refuse to
      let you come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t possibly stay away for a month,&rdquo; Rose said firmly, but with
      the air of a martyr. &ldquo;Aunt Lucy looked heartbroken when I asked for a week
      this time. She has got to depend on me for everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. But if you were away she would do things for herself, and it
      would be a thousand times better for her. She won&rsquo;t have missed you this
      time as much as you fear, Rosie. And won&rsquo;t you think of me a little bit?
      Just think how lonely I shall be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know. And I <i>want</i> to come again,&rdquo; Rose said piteously. &ldquo;I
      might get away for a week in May. If you spoke to Aunt Lucy&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust it to me entirely, dear. I know exactly what to say. And I feel
      sure your aunt will let you be free when she understands how much you want
      it. For a week or so, I mean,&rdquo; she added hastily, as she saw Rose&rsquo;s
      anxious look. &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t ask for more, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit of good to ask,&rdquo; sighed Rose. &ldquo;If Aunt Lucy said I
      might stay longer, she would look so miserable about it I should not like
      to take her at her word. But I might be spared for a week, I should think.
      That will be something to look forward to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They reached Woodcote early in the afternoon, and Pauline was soon
      furnished with an opportunity to plead Rose&rsquo;s cause with Miss Merivale.
      Tom had bought a new pony which he wanted Rose to see, and they went away
      to the stables, leaving their aunt and Pauline alone. Pauline had
      laughingly refused to accompany them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to tell Miss Merivale what Mrs. Metcalfe said about your
      music, Rose,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It would make you vain if you were to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Mrs. Metcalfe?&rdquo; asked Tom, when they got outside. &ldquo;Is she a great
      authority, Rose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is Lady Desborough&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo; returned Rose, with dignity. &ldquo;Pauline
      and I went to tea there yesterday. She lives in Grosvenor Square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I understand now why Miss Smythe spoke of her with bated breath,&rdquo;
       returned Tom in the light, bantering tone which so often irritated Rose.
      &ldquo;I might have known she lived in Grosvenor Square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose refused to take notice of his raillery. &ldquo;It was Mrs. Metcalfe who got
      Miss Sampson for Clare. She heard of her through some agency. What has
      made Aunt Lucy take such an interest in her, Tom? She was down here again
      yesterday, wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Have you seen her, Rosie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a moment or two. She looked nice, I thought. But I can&rsquo;t imagine what
      Aunt Lucy can find for her to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Lucy is sure that she must be related to Cousin Lydia&rsquo;s husband. It
      is natural that she should take a great interest in her. She is coming
      down again next week to stay for a day or two. Aunt Lucy told me this
      morning that she meant to ask her. I am sure you will like her, Rosie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom spoke without looking at his sister, and hurried forward to open the
      gate of the stable yard for her without waiting to get an answer. But Rose
      had no answer ready. The tone in which Tom had spoken took her breath
      away. He seemed to think it was a matter of importance whether she liked
      Miss Sampson or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got back to the house, Tom went off to his own den, and when
      Rose entered the drawing-room she found Pauline alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter ran towards her and caught her by both hands. Her eyes were
      sparkling joyfully. &ldquo;My Rose, I have delightful news for you. Now, confess
      that I am the cleverest person in the world! I have made your aunt as
      anxious as you are about your music. She wants you to spend two months
      with me in London. Two whole long, lovely months! Think of it, Rosamunda
      mia! And you can come next week. It is far, far more than I ever hoped
      for. And, who knows, you might get an extension of leave after that. We
      may spend the whole summer together in the flat. Well, why don&rsquo;t you say
      something? Aren&rsquo;t you pleased?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Pauline, I can&rsquo;t go. Aunt Lucy couldn&rsquo;t do without me. I&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, she wants you to go,&rdquo; returned Pauline impatiently. &ldquo;Go up and
      speak to her, and you will find it is so. Miss Sampson is to come here as
      her companion. She isn&rsquo;t the person I should choose for a companion, but
      <i>chacun à son goût</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you suggest that she should come here?&rdquo; asked Rose. &ldquo;Oh, Pauline,
      don&rsquo;t look at me like that! It is so sudden. And Aunt Lucy can&rsquo;t bear
      strangers. I don&rsquo;t think it is a good plan at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline dropped her hands with one look, and turned away. Her lips were
      quivering; her face had the stricken look of one who has received a cruel
      blow. She did not speak, but Rose was full of remorse instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Pauline, you know I want to come to you. It would be too lovely. But
      it is so sudden. I can&rsquo;t believe Aunt Lucy would like to have Miss Sampson
      with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better speak to your aunt,&rdquo; returned Pauline in an icy voice. &ldquo;I
      wash my hands of the matter altogether. I did my best for you; but I see I
      was mistaken in thinking that you really cared about our being together.
      It does not matter I can give up the flat and go back to Mrs. Jephson&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pauline, don&rsquo;t speak like that,&rdquo; begged Rose, with tears in her eyes.
      &ldquo;You know how I love being with you. If I could be certain Aunt Lucy would
      not fret for me, I should be only too delighted to get away. I never feel
      more than half-alive here. But Miss Sampson could not do for her what I
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you may exaggerate your usefulness to your aunt, dear?&rdquo;
       Pauline returned, with a sneer. But with an effort she controlled her
      temper, and spoke the next words in a different tone. &ldquo;Miss Merivale seems
      really anxious for you to have a change, Rose. I think she understands
      that you are bored and unhappy here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Pauline, you did not say that to her?&rdquo; cried Rose, the blood rushing,
      up into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, darling. It was your music I spoke most of. But she does
      want you to come to me. Go up and speak to her; you will see that she
      really wants it. You won&rsquo;t make difficulties, Rose? Can&rsquo;t you see it is
      best for both of you to be apart for a time? Your aunt will learn to do
      without you. When you come back you will be able to lead a much freer
      life. And think of the happy time we shall have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Rose&rsquo;s face did not light up as Pauline had expected, and it was with
      a very sober step that she went up to her aunt&rsquo;s room. She had made up her
      mind to tell her aunt that she did not want to go and stay with Pauline&mdash;that
      she had never really thought of leaving her. She expected to be clasped
      and fondly kissed for being so ready to give up her visit; but she found,
      to her hurt surprise, that Pauline had been right, and that her aunt was
      bent on her going away for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a chance that may not happen again, Rosie,&rdquo; she said, tenderly
      stroking her bright hair. &ldquo;I have wanted you to have some really good
      music lessons for a long time, and Pauline and Mrs. Metcalfe will be able
      to see that you get the best. And you have been looking pale lately. You
      want a change; I know it has been dull for you. And I should like to have
      Rhoda here for a time. I have just been talking to Tom about it. He thinks
      it an excellent plan. You would like to go next week, wouldn&rsquo;t you,
      darling? Pauline is very anxious to have you. Before she goes away we must
      settle how long you are to stay. Two months, I thought of. I can&rsquo;t spare
      you longer than that, Rosie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, affectionate as these words were, and loving the kiss that
      accompanied them, Rose went downstairs again with a sore heart. She was
      like those who pluck Dead Sea apples, and find the fruit that looked so
      fair when out of reach turning to ashes in their hands.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. APPLES OF SODOM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One warm, beautiful morning, early in April, Rose was toiling rather
      wearily up the long flight of stone steps leading to the flat. She had her
      violin, and she found it heavy. She was wishing she had Tom with her to
      carry it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Rose had not yet confessed it to herself, she was beginning to be a
      little homesick. She missed the delicious freshness of Woodcote, its wide
      rooms and sunny gardens, the thousand and one little comforts she had been
      too accustomed to to notice; but more, far, far more, she missed the
      protecting fondness that had surrounded her all her life. It was only a
      fortnight since she joined Pauline, but it seemed much longer. And June
      seemed a very long way off.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was looking forward to a great treat that afternoon. Paderewski
      was playing at St. James&rsquo;s Hall, and she and Pauline were going early to
      get seats. They would have to wait two hours or so, and might have to
      stand after all, but to Rose that was part of the afternoon&rsquo;s enjoyment.
      She had quite agreed with Pauline that it would be foolish to go to the
      expense of taking their tickets beforehand. She opened the door with her
      latch-key&mdash;that latch-key still gave her a thrill of proud delight
      when she used it&mdash;and went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline called to her from her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosie, is that you, dearest? I want to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose put down her violin and crossed the tiny entry. Pauline was standing
      before her looking-glass doing her hair. She wore a soiled pink
      dressing-jacket elaborately trimmed with lace, and Rose observed with a
      little shock that there were holes in the heels of her stockings. It was
      not quite such a shock as it would have been a fortnight ago. Rose had
      discovered that Pauline was very careless about little matters of this
      sort. On the bed was spread out her last new dress&mdash;a charming
      combination of brown and gold, to be worn with a brown hat lined with
      yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Pauline, you won&rsquo;t wear that dress this afternoon, will you?&rdquo; asked
      Rose, glancing at it. &ldquo;It will get so crushed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Rose, shall you be very disappointed? Madame Verney has asked me to go
      with her. She had two tickets sent her, and Monsieur Verney had to go to
      Paris this morning. I am going there to lunch. How I wish you were going
      with me, darling! But I could not refuse when Madame Verney asked me,
      could I? I might have offended her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears had rushed into Rose&rsquo;s eyes, but she drove them back. &ldquo;I daresay
      Paderewski will play again before I go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And it was kind of
      Madame Verney to ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as to kindness, she would have found it dull enough to go by herself,
      and she knows nobody in London yet. But what do you mean about Paderewski
      playing again, Rosie? You&rsquo;ll go and hear him this afternoon, won&rsquo;t you? I
      never thought of your staying at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised Aunt Lucy I would not go to a concert by myself,&rdquo; Rose
      answered hastily. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go, Pauline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she meant in the evening, Rosie. She couldn&rsquo;t mind your going this
      afternoon. Don&rsquo;t be a silly child. You&rsquo;ll spoil my pleasure if you stay at
      home. Of course you must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Rose. &ldquo;I promised Aunt Lucy. Besides&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little country mouse!&rdquo; laughed Pauline. &ldquo;I believe you are afraid to
      go. Who do you think would eat you? Never mind, there is &lsquo;The Golden
      Legend&rsquo; at the Albert Hall on Thursday. We&rsquo;ll go to that. But I must be
      quick; I promised to be there early. Rosie, be my good angel, and clean my
      shoes for me. You&rsquo;ll find the stuff in that box. I can&rsquo;t trust Mrs.
      Richards with my kid shoes. No, not that box, darling, the one below it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose, who was delicately fastidious about all her own belongings, could
      never understand how Pauline allowed her room to be so untidy, and as she
      opened the box and took out the pot of polish she blushed to find herself
      thinking of Aunt Dinah and her kitchen drawers in <i>Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin</i>.
      She took the boots away and cleaned them, and brought them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Richards isn&rsquo;t in the kitchen, Pauline. She hasn&rsquo;t gone, has she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear little Rosie! Was she afraid she was going to be left all
      alone?&rdquo; laughed Pauline. &ldquo;She has only gone to get me a hansom, dear. I
      shall spoil my dress if I go by omnibus, and it is too far to walk. Have
      you five shillings in your purse you can lend me? I am hard up till the
      end of the term.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose produced the five shillings, which was not by any means the first
      loan Pauline had asked for. She hated herself for feeling so hurt and
      angry with her friend, and she was glad to lend her the money she wanted.
      Life would become quite intolerable in the flat if she was going to lose
      her belief in Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you think better of it and go to the concert?&rdquo; Pauline said, when
      she was ready to start. &ldquo;It is really silly of you to stay at home,
      dearest. I wouldn&rsquo;t have accepted Madame Verney&rsquo;s invitation if I had
      thought you would not go. But you see how it is, don&rsquo;t you? Her cousin is
      at the French Embassy, and she is sure to get to know a lot of people. She
      may introduce me to a great many pupils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sounded reasonable, and Pauline&rsquo;s voice was most kind and caressing,
      yet somehow the hurt feeling remained in Rose&rsquo;s heart. She saw that
      Pauline was delighted to go. She did not really care in the least about
      her disappointment. &ldquo;He will be sure to play again,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I
      shall go for a walk in the Park. What time shall you be back, Pauline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline hesitated. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect me till the evening, darling. Madame
      Verney spoke about my going back with her to tea. Shall you be very
      lonely? I never used to trouble about Clare. She went her way, and I went
      mine. And&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not trouble about me,&rdquo; Rose flashed out, her colour rising. &ldquo;I
      should be sorry to spoil your afternoon, Pauline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline looked at her with grieved eyes. &ldquo;It will make me most miserable
      if I leave you angry with me. Don&rsquo;t you know that I would far, far rather
      have gone with you? Rosie, you know that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Rose had a stubborn love of truth, which prevented her from responding
      to this appeal as Pauline wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been a pity for you to refuse Madame Verney,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;And I shall have a nice afternoon. I will make some cakes, I think. I
      want to astonish Aunt Lucy and Wilmot when I go home. I shall make Wilmot
      let me make Tom&rsquo;s birthday cake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline patted her cheek. &ldquo;What a child you are still, Rosie! When you
      have been a month or two in London, you will find yourself growing up. But
      I must start. How does this dress suit me? Do you think there is just a
      little too much yellow about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose could frankly say that the dress was perfect. She had never seen
      Pauline look better. But she could not help hoping that she had changed
      her stockings as she watched her run lightly down the stairs to the
      hansom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt very downhearted as she closed the door and went back to the
      sitting-room. The room was sweet with the primroses and white violets they
      had sent her from Woodcote the day before. Rose felt herself pitying the
      flowers for being taken from the woods and sent to wither in that stifling
      air. For it was stifling this afternoon. Even when she threw open the
      window, no breath of coolness came to fan her burning face. The sky was
      cloudless, but yellow with smoke, and a dull haze hung over the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose thought of Woodcote, where the great chestnuts were already in full
      leaf, and the gorse common beyond the wood was a sheet of gold. An intense
      longing took hold of her to go home, if only for an hour or two. She
      looked at her watch and saw that it was not yet one o&rsquo;clock. There was
      plenty of time to go to Woodcote and get back before Pauline returned. And
      how joyfully surprised her aunt would be! She wondered she had not thought
      of it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later she was in the train, speeding countrywards. She sat close
      to the window, looking eagerly at the green fields and the budding trees.
      She no longer felt disappointed about the concert. She was glad Madame
      Verney had invited Pauline to go with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just outside the station for Woodcote the train came to a standstill. Rose
      from the window had a full view of the white road down the hillside, and
      as she looked along it she caught sight of an approaching carriage. It was
      a moment before she recognised the brown horses and the broad figure of
      old Harris, her aunt&rsquo;s coachman. But directly afterwards she saw her aunt
      and Rhoda Sampson, and Tom seated opposite to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road passed close to the high embankment on which the train was
      standing. If they had looked up, they must have seen her at the window.
      But they were too intent on their conversation. Rose heard Tom laugh at
      something Rhoda said, and saw him turn to Miss Merivale as if she too was
      enjoying the joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose could not see her aunt&rsquo;s face, her parasol shaded it; but she was not
      leaning back against the cushions, as she usually did. She was bending a
      little forward, with her face turned towards Rhoda. It was quite plain to
      Rose that it was Miss Sampson who was absorbing the attention both of Tom
      and her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared after the carriage with angry, mystified eyes. It was her place
      Rhoda was sitting in! She forgot how the long drives her aunt loved used
      to bore her. She felt that Rhoda Sampson had no right to be sitting there,
      and it seemed to her positively cruel of her aunt and Tom to be so happy
      when she was away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was half inclined to go back by the next train when she heard from the
      stationmaster that they were gone to Guilford and would not be back till
      late. But on second thoughts she determined to go on to Woodcote. Wilmot
      would be there, at any rate. She would be able to find out how her aunt
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had the warmest of greetings from the old cook and housekeeper, whom
      she found at the linen press upstairs, carefully examining her store of
      lavender-scented linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your aunt will be dreadfully disappointed, Miss Rosie. What a pity you
      didn&rsquo;t come a little earlier! You could ha&rsquo; gone to Guilford with them.
      They&rsquo;ve gone about the new greenhouse Mr. Tom is going to build. But come
      down to the dining-room, my dearie, and I&rsquo;ll get you some tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; finish what you were about,&rdquo; returned Rose, settling herself in
      the window-seat. The linen press stood on a wide landing that had a window
      looking on the garden. It had always been a favourite spot with Rose; in
      the deep-cushioned window-seat she had spent many a happy afternoon. The
      linen press was of old oak, almost as old as the house. And opposite it
      stood a finely-carved dower-chest with the date 1511 carved upon it. The
      landing-floor, like the stairs, was of polished oak, and the wainscoted
      walls had one or two old pictures on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose looked round her, feeling as she had never felt before the beauty of
      her home. How fresh it was, and roomy! And what a delicious scent of
      lavender came from the old linen press! &ldquo;What are you doing, Wilmot? I
      wish you would let me help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, my dearie. I&rsquo;ve got what I wanted. It&rsquo;s this tablecloth
      Miss Sampson is going to darn for me. She&rsquo;s the cleverest young lady with
      her needle I ever came across, and that anxious to be useful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you like her?&rdquo; asked Rose. She could not help a certain stiffness
      getting into her voice when she mentioned Rhoda, though she was ready to
      laugh at herself for being jealous of her aunt&rsquo;s companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody could help liking her, Miss Rosie. It&rsquo;s just like having a bit o&rsquo; 
      sunshine in the house. The mistress would ha&rsquo; missed you bad enough if she
      hadn&rsquo;t had Miss Sampson to cheer her up. But nobody could feel lonely with
      her about. And it&rsquo;s wonderful what she knows about a garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they have gardens in Australia?&rdquo; asked Rose. It was the sort of remark
      Pauline might have made. But Rose was feeling very cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilmot did not notice the spitefulness in her voice. &ldquo;They seem to have
      lovely gardens out there, my dearie. Miss Sampson was telling me of the
      different flowering trees they&rsquo;ve got when she was in the kitchen on
      Tuesday. I&rsquo;d promised to show her how to make those drop cakes you&rsquo;re so
      fond of, Miss Rosie. But I&rsquo;ll go and see about your tea. I wish you&rsquo;d come
      this morning. The mistress was saying only yesterday that she was longing
      to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose went up to her room while tea was being made ready for her. It was
      all in perfect order, as if ready for her to take possession of it at any
      moment. There was even a vase of fresh primroses on the little table by
      the window. The room that had been prepared for Rhoda was next to it. The
      door stood partly open, and Rose could not forbear taking one look. It was
      only one look. She hurried on, feeling ashamed of her curiosity. But she
      got an impression of exquisite neatness and freshness, and by some odd
      working of the law of contrast it was Pauline&rsquo;s room she thought of as she
      ran downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dining-room she noticed with jealous eyes how carefully the plants
      in the flower-stands before the windows had been tended, and with what
      care and skill the flowers on the table had been arranged. Wilmot hung
      round her at tea, pressing her to eat all sorts of dainties, and she could
      have easily learnt a great deal about Rhoda. The old servant seemed
      anxious to speak of her, anxious to impress Rose with her sweetness and
      goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rose cut her short. She refused to interest herself in the stranger
      who in a few weeks&rsquo; time would pass out of their lives again. And she grew
      cross at last at Wilmot&rsquo;s continual praises of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went back by an earlier train than she had intended. She found that
      her aunt and the others would not return till dark; it was no good to wait
      for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked from Victoria to Chelsea along the Embankment, trying to
      convince herself that it was good to be in London. But her step flagged as
      she went up the stone stairs, and when she got to the flat and found that
      Pauline had not returned, a great flood of loneliness rushed over her. She
      put her flowers down on the table, and, covering her face with her hands,
      she burst into tears.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. AN INVITATION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock when Pauline returned. Madame Verney had begged
      her so hard to stay and keep her company that she had not been able to
      refuse, she told Rose, with many caresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking of you all the time, you poor darling. But what
      could I do? Félicie&mdash;she begged me this evening to call her Félicie&mdash;was
      so bent on my staying. I am going to take you to see her tomorrow. I
      talked so much about my little English Rose. And what have you been doing
      with yourself? What a pity you did not go to the concert! It was glorious.
      We had delightful seats. I never enjoyed a concert so much before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been to Woodcote,&rdquo; Rose broke in. &ldquo;It was such a lovely afternoon
      I could not stay indoors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline looked dismayed. &ldquo;To Woodcote?&rdquo; she said sharply. &ldquo;What a strange
      idea, Rose! I thought you were going into the Park. Was not Miss Merivale
      surprised to see you alone? I fancy she thinks we are like the Siamese
      Twins&mdash;always together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not see Aunt Lucy. They had all gone to Guilford. I only saw
      Wilmot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilmot? That&rsquo;s the cook, isn&rsquo;t it? I never can remember servants&rsquo; names.
      Well, did she condole with you about the concert, and think me a wretch
      for deserting you? I am afraid Miss Merivale will think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything about the concert,&rdquo; returned Rose. &ldquo;She talked
      about Miss Sampson chiefly. She seems to think her perfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; returned Pauline, with a yawn. &ldquo;Those sort of people always
      hang together. She&rsquo;s more of Wilmot&rsquo;s class than ours, you know. I wonder
      what your aunt thinks of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Aunt Lucy thinks her perfect too,&rdquo; returned Rose, no longer able to
      keep her jealousy out of her voice. &ldquo;And so does Tom. I don&rsquo;t believe they
      miss me one little bit, Pauline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Wilmot tell you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I am sure they don&rsquo;t. Little things she said made me think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You silly child!&rdquo; laughed Pauline. &ldquo;Did you want your aunt to fret
      herself to death because you weren&rsquo;t there to run her errands? You ought
      to be glad she finds Miss Sampson so useful. She may be willing to let you
      stay on with me all the summer. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be delightful? Why, what a
      gloomy little face! Rose, I believe you are angry because I accepted
      Félicie&rsquo;s invitation. But I am not going to leave you alone again. I must
      remember you are not like Clare. You are vexed with me, now confess it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you could not help it,&rdquo; Rose answered wearily. &ldquo;And I was glad to
      go home. I shall go again on Saturday. You must come with me, Pauline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell your aunt that I wanted you to go to the concert alone, then,&rdquo;
       said Pauline, with a laugh. &ldquo;She is such a dear old-fashioned thing, she
      might be shocked at me. And I believe you were shocked, just a little. How
      Clare would have laughed at you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an expression of alarm in Pauline&rsquo;s eyes as she watched Rose.
      She began to fear that she had really offended her by her behaviour. She
      had been so sure of her influence that she had not thought it necessary to
      consider her, but she told herself now that she had been distinctly
      foolish. And she tried her best to make Rose forget that she had been
      deserted for a new friend. But she could not chase away the shadow from
      Rose&rsquo;s face. It was not her disappointment about the concert which had
      brought it there. It was the feeling that she was not being missed at
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning she was practising her scales in the sitting-room, after
      Pauline had gone to give some lessons, when Tom was ushered in by Mrs.
      Richards. Rose ran to meet him with a glad cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Tom, this is nice! Has Aunt Lucy come with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she sent me. She wants you and Miss Smythe to spend Saturday to
      Monday with us. Why didn&rsquo;t you let us know you were coming yesterday,
      Rosie? Aunt Lucy was so disappointed when she found you had come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of it till the middle of the day. You had gone to
      Guilford, they told me. Wasn&rsquo;t that too far for Aunt Lucy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should it be?&rdquo; asked Tom in a surprised tone. &ldquo;She has often driven
      as far as that. She seemed to enjoy it. She is certainly stronger, Rosie.
      But you will see on Saturday. You look rather pale. Come out with me. If
      you&rsquo;ll ask me to lunch, I can stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose hesitated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you would like Mrs. Richards&rsquo; cooking, Tom.
      I would rather you wouldn&rsquo;t stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You inhospitable sister! Well, I&rsquo;ll ask you to lunch with me. Run and put
      your hat on and let us go out. It is a glorious morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched her rather impatiently as she got the case and began to put her
      violin away. He was anxious to get her out into the open air. It
      distressed him to see how pale she was. And he had an uneasy feeling that
      he had been neglecting his little sister lately. For days he had hardly
      thought of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t practising too hard, I hope, Rosie?&rdquo; he said kindly. &ldquo;You
      mustn&rsquo;t overdo it, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t practise too much,&rdquo; Rose returned. She did not tell him that
      she found it impossible to practise except when Pauline was out. Pauline&rsquo;s
      neuralgia came on directly she began to play. &ldquo;And how does Miss Sampson
      suit, Tom? I hope she looks after Aunt Lucy properly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom flushed up. &ldquo;You will see for yourself on Saturday, Rosie. Aunt Lucy
      is very fond of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Wilmot told me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom gave his sister a hasty glance, was on the point of saying something,
      but checked himself. And there was a moment&rsquo;s silence before he spoke. &ldquo;I
      wish you had not settled to stay here till June, Rosie. We want you at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in a choked voice Rose answered him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you do want
      me. Aunt Lucy has got Miss Sampson. She doesn&rsquo;t want me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom again paused a moment before he spoke. Each time Rose mentioned Rhoda
      in that slighting tone it roused his anger against her. But he told
      himself that Rose did not know Rhoda yet, and he must wait till they had
      seen something of each other before he could expect Rose&rsquo;s sympathy. He
      spoke very calmly and reasonably after the pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you wish Aunt Lucy to be miserable while you were away, Rose? It was
      your own wish to go. Surely you ought to be glad that she has found
      someone to fill your place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt he had said the wrong thing before Rose turned on him, her eyes
      flashing. &ldquo;How could Miss Sampson, a stranger, fill my place? Tom, you are
      horrid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he said stoutly, bent on defending the position he had taken
      up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you, Rosie; but look at the thing reasonably.
      Remember that you told me you were bored to death at home, that you would
      give anything to live in London all the year round. I didn&rsquo;t believe you.
      But suppose you had really wanted it? You couldn&rsquo;t have expected to keep
      your place at home and yet have the freedom of a life like this. If a girl
      gives up her home duties, she must take the consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only been away a fortnight,&rdquo; said Rose, with a trembling lip, &ldquo;and
      I shall feel nothing but a visitor when I go back on Saturday. You&mdash;you
      only ask me because I went home yesterday and found you gone. I don&rsquo;t
      believe you want me a bit.&rdquo; And, to Tom&rsquo;s distress and amazement, Rose,
      poor little homesick Rose, burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would go back with me this minute and you&rsquo;d find out whether
      we wanted you,&rdquo; he exclaimed, drawing her hands down from her face. &ldquo;You
      silly child, what would Aunt Lucy say if she heard you talking such
      nonsense? Rosie, just listen to me a moment. I am going to tell you
      something I haven&rsquo;t even told Aunt Lucy yet, though I believe she guesses.
      Don&rsquo;t cry any more. Just listen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quiver in Tom&rsquo;s voice made Rose look wonderingly at him. It was very
      unlike him to show any emotion. His cool, matter-of-fact way of looking at
      things had often irritated her. But she saw now that he was deeply moved.
      And the reason of his agitation suddenly flashed upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Tom!&rdquo; she faltered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosie, you&rsquo;ll try to like her?&rdquo; he said eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      sure of nothing, except that I shall never be happy again unless&mdash;Rosie,
      you will be nice to her? You don&rsquo;t know her. There is nobody like her. You
      won&rsquo;t be able to help liking her, I&rsquo;m sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose was still looking at him with wide-open, wondering eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Tom, is she&mdash;is she a lady?&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He frowned. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t sixteen quarterings on her shield, if you mean
      that. But you won&rsquo;t ask the question again when you have seen her, Rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose did not remind him that she had seen her. She was trying to recall
      her as she sat at the side table busy over her typewriting. Her jealousy
      of Rhoda had somehow vanished in the light of Tom&rsquo;s wonderful confession.
      She was eager to see the girl again who might one day be her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think Aunt Lucy knows, Tom?&rdquo; she asked in a doubtful voice.
      Tom&rsquo;s future wife had been often a subject for conversation between Miss
      Merivale and Rose. And of the two, Miss Merivale had been the more
      ambitious in her wishes. She had seemed to think that hardly anyone could
      be good enough for Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she knows,&rdquo; returned Tom, with conviction. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t say
      anything to her, Rosie. I shouldn&rsquo;t have told you unless&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you told me, Tom,&rdquo; said Rose, drawing a deep breath. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m
      sure I shall like her. I&rsquo;m sure she must be nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom beamed at her. &ldquo;But you did see her for a moment, Rosie. She came here
      while you were staying with Miss Smythe last month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she sat at that table, and wrote the letters,&rdquo; Rose said, nodding
      towards the little side table in the corner. &ldquo;She had a brown dress on, I
      remember. Tom, am I expected to say that I thought her very pretty? I
      hardly looked at her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you will see her on Saturday,&rdquo; Tom said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose noticed that his voice sounded quite different when he spoke of
      Rhoda. And there came a look into his face she had never seen there
      before. It was impossible for her to cherish any jealous feelings in face
      of the great fact that Tom was in love. It thrilled her to think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, when Tom was gone, and she and Pauline were sitting together
      in their little sitting-room, she let her book lie unheeded on her lap,
      while she looked forward dreamily into the future. She took it for granted
      that Tom and Rhoda would marry. It seemed quite out of the question that
      Tom could be refused. How strange it would be to have a sister! She had so
      often wished for a sister. She hoped Rhoda would soon learn to love her.
      She thought of her quite naturally as Rhoda now, and was tremulously eager
      to see her again. She was sure that the girl Tom loved must be worthy of
      his love. And the fact that he had made her his confidante had taken all
      bitterness out of her heart. She was proud that he had trusted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosie, whatever is your little head full of?&rdquo; asked Pauline suddenly. She
      had been watching her for some moments, unable to interpret the shining,
      far-off look in her blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose pave a start and looked hastily round. &ldquo;I was thinking of Tom,&rdquo; she
      said, feeling her colour rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom ought to be flattered,&rdquo; laughed Pauline. &ldquo;I believe you had forgotten
      my existence. How you started when I spoke! Where were you? At Woodcote?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy so,&rdquo; said Rose, getting up and stretching her hands above her
      head. &ldquo;Shall we have supper now, Pauline? I wonder why that lamp smells
      so. Ours never do at home. I must ask Wilmot how to clean it. I am sure
      Mrs. Richards can&rsquo;t do it properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose she does, my dear. I believe Sampson tried to teach her.
      She&rsquo;s a domestic genius, isn&rsquo;t she? I am beginning to feel grateful to
      Sampson. If your aunt had not heard of her you wouldn&rsquo;t have come to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pauline, I wish you would not speak of her like that,&rdquo; said Rose, with a
      note of irritation in her voice. &ldquo;Why do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I? It isn&rsquo;t as if she was a lady. One of her uncles is a
      butcher; she told Clare so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why she should be ashamed of it,&rdquo; returned Rose, answering
      Pauline&rsquo;s tone rather than her words. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what people are in themselves
      that matters, not what trade their relations belong to. But Miss Sampson
      has no relations of her very own. The M&rsquo;Alisters adopted her. And Aunt
      Lucy thinks that her uncle might have been Cousin Lydia&rsquo;s husband. It is
      that which made Aunt Lucy so interested in her at first. For, you know, if
      Cousin Lydia&rsquo;s little girl had lived, she would have had Woodcote, and not
      Tom. And she and her father would have come to England when Uncle James
      died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline was watching Rose&rsquo;s face curiously. She did not feel any interest
      in Cousin Lydia and her husband, but she could not understand Rose&rsquo;s
      change of attitude towards Rhoda Sampson. One explanation occurred to her&mdash;a
      delightful one. Had Rose made up her mind to spend the summer in London
      with her? Was this the reason she felt glad that her aunt had someone she
      liked to take her place?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as I said before, Rosie, I am grateful to Miss Rhoda Sampson,&rdquo; she
      said laughingly. &ldquo;If she was not at Woodcote, you would not be here. And I
      shall get more and more grateful to her as the weeks go on. I may get to
      love her in time, if she enables us to spend the summer together. You are
      quite happy about your aunt now, aren&rsquo;t you, my Rose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose looked aghast at the prospect of spending the whole summer in the
      flat. She hardly knew how she was to endure it till June.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go home in June, Pauline,&rdquo; she said hastily. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stay
      longer than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall see,&rdquo; said Pauline gaily. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t talk so lightly about
      going back when you have had a few more weeks of freedom, Rose. And if
      your aunt is so well provided for, there will be no need for you to go
      back. You won&rsquo;t be wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I shall be,&rdquo; Rose answered, with a swelling heart. Tom had made
      her feel sure of that. &ldquo;Pauline, please don&rsquo;t think about my staying here
      after June. I can&rsquo;t stay. I want to go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t forgiven me for that wretched concert!&rdquo; Pauline exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thought of it again. It isn&rsquo;t that, Pauline. How could it be?
      But I want to go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be miserable, just as you were before. Remember how you talked
      to me. You were bored to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose flushed scarlet. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t. Or if I was, I don&rsquo;t mean to be so silly
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline looked at her with an angry glance. &ldquo;You are a homesick baby,
      Rose, that is the long and short of it. I gave you credit for being
      grown-up. It was a mistake you coming here at all. Clare didn&rsquo;t get
      homesick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare had her work,&rdquo; answered Rose, knitting her pretty brows and looking
      miserably at Pauline&rsquo;s angry face. &ldquo;I am doing nothing I couldn&rsquo;t do as
      well at home. I could come up once a week for lessons. Pauline, don&rsquo;t be
      angry. You didn&rsquo;t really think I should stay on after June, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave you credit for meaning what you said,&rdquo; returned Pauline harshly.
      &ldquo;And what you said was true. You were not happy at home. If you go back,
      you will get bored and unhappy again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose shook her head. She had had a sharp lesson. She knew what the freedom
      was worth that Pauline had offered her. She longed to take up again the
      little daily cares that had filled her life at home. And she longed to get
      away from Pauline. She was beginning to feel that she had never really
      known her till now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline waited a moment for her to speak, and then turned sharply away.
      &ldquo;Well, I shall not press you to stay with me. Madame Verney would be glad
      if I could live with her. I said it was impossible yesterday, as I was
      bound to you. Now I shall feel quite free to make my own arrangements. But
      you have disappointed me, Rose. I must tell you so quite frankly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Rose felt quite crushed for the moment by the judicial air with which
      Pauline pronounced this judgment on her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. PAULINE HAS HER SUSPICIONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pauline and Rose went down to Woodcote on Friday evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline had apparently recovered her spirits, and was in her brightest
      mood. She had been very sweet and caressing to Rose ever since their talk
      on the evening of Tom&rsquo;s visit to the flat. Rose inwardly chafed at this
      show of affection; she had ceased to believe in Pauline&rsquo;s sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale was waiting at the station for them with the pony carriage.
      The groom had driven her down, but Rose begged to be allowed to drive
      back. It was the first time she had driven the new pony, which was a
      pretty, gentle, timid creature, obedient to the lightest touch on the
      reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must take Miss Smythe to Bingley woods to-morrow, Rose dear,&rdquo; Miss
      Merivale said, as they drove slowly up the long hill from the station.
      &ldquo;The primroses are very plentiful this year. Tom says the ground is
      carpeted with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose did not answer. The pony had started aside at the sight of a railway
      train that had just come out of the tunnel, and she was engaged in
      soothing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose, you had better let me drive,&rdquo; Pauline suggested. &ldquo;I drove a great
      deal when I was staying with the Warehams. You are not firm enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only trains and traction engines Bob is frightened of,&rdquo; Miss
      Merivale said. &ldquo;And coaxing is best, I am sure. There, we shall have no
      more trouble with him now. He is a dear little fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline said nothing, but she had some difficulty in keeping herself from
      shrugging her shoulders. She thought both Miss Merivale and Rose
      deplorably weak and silly. A smart stroke with the whip was what the pony
      wanted. But she had come down determined to be on her best behaviour, and
      she made some smiling remark on the beauty of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose has been pining for fresh air like a lark in a cage,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Are
      you content now, Rosie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom said she looked pale,&rdquo; Miss Merivale said, giving Rose an anxious,
      loving glance. &ldquo;I wish you would come down again next week, dear. I can&rsquo;t
      let a fortnight pass again without seeing you; it is much too long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time goes faster in London,&rdquo; said Pauline, without allowing Rose to
      answer. &ldquo;It seems only yesterday that Rose came to me. How quiet it is
      here! Don&rsquo;t you miss the roar of London, Rosie? I do. Not the clatter of
      cabs and carts, but that deep, low roar we hear when we open the window.
      It is like the voice of the great city. There is no music like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather hear the birds,&rdquo; Miss Merivale said gently; but she gave
      Rosie another anxious look. She was wondering if the time had gone as
      quickly with her as with Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose did not speak. She was waiting till they got home to pour her heart
      out to her aunt. She could not speak before Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I haven&rsquo;t many rustic tastes,&rdquo; Pauline said in a cool,
      superior voice. &ldquo;But it is certainly lovely here. What a delightful change
      it must be for that little Miss Sampson! I hear you find her very useful,
      Miss Merivale. Clare will be pleased to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in her life Pauline saw Miss Merivale look angry. Her
      mild blue eyes actually flashed as she answered in a voice that trembled a
      little, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can have heard that Rhoda is related to us,
      Miss Smythe. She is staying with me as my visitor. Rose, my dear, I want
      you to be very good to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline stole a look at Rose, expecting to see a cloud of jealousy on her
      pretty face; but she saw instead a tender, happy smile lurking in the
      corners of her lips. She was distinctly mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember now that Rose spoke of some distant family connection,&rdquo;
       she said carelessly to Miss Merivale. &ldquo;How very good of you to acknowledge
      it, dear Miss Merivale! Some people wouldn&rsquo;t, I know. They think poor
      relations should be kept out of sight as much as possible. But Miss
      Sampson is hardly to be called a relation, is she? I forget the exact link
      between you, though Rose told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is related to poor Cousin Lydia&rsquo;s second husband,&rdquo; Rose said, as Miss
      Merivale did not answer. &ldquo;He and his little girl were lost in the bush,
      weren&rsquo;t they, Aunt Lucy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; said Miss Merivale in a low voice. Her face had become very
      white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she had lived, we might never have come to Woodcote,&rdquo; Rose went on,
      her glance resting lovingly on the old house, which had just come into
      sight. &ldquo;How strange it seems to think of that! How old was she, Aunt Lucy?
      It is only lately I have thought of her at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was about two years old, dear,&rdquo; Miss Merivale answered in the same
      low voice. Pauline, who was watching her in some wonder, could see that
      she was profoundly agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she would have been about twenty now,&rdquo; Rose went on, not noticing
      her aunt&rsquo;s disinclination to talk of her niece. &ldquo;How old is Miss Sampson,
      Aunt Lucy? I wonder if they ever saw each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is nearly twenty; I remember Clare telling me so,&rdquo; said Pauline,
      answering for Miss Merivale. &ldquo;But she looks much older. It is the kind of
      life she has lived, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose was intent on turning the curve of the drive in a masterly manner,
      and did not answer this. And Pauline, after another glance at Miss
      Merivale&rsquo;s face, was silent about Rhoda. It was plain to her that, for
      some reason or another, the subject was intensely painful to Miss
      Merivale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda came shyly across the hall as they entered. She had on a new brown
      dress that Miss Merivale had given her. It was brown cashmere, made very
      simply, but it was a prettier dress than Pauline had ever seen her
      wearing, and she stared undisguisedly at her as they shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly knew you, Miss Sampson,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How very well you are
      looking! But you must be having quite a holiday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The condescending tone did not appear to irritate Rhoda. She answered
      pleasantly; there was even a twinkle deep down in her dark eyes as she met
      Pauline&rsquo;s glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Rose who felt irritated. Now that she saw Rhoda&rsquo;s face in the full
      light, with no hat to shade it, she recognised what a frank, sweet face it
      was. She did not wonder that Tom loved her, or that her aunt smiled upon
      his wooing. And Pauline&rsquo;s assumption of superiority vexed her intensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale asked Rhoda to show Pauline the room that had been prepared
      for her, and they went upstairs together. Rose cast an anxious glance
      after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had better go too, Aunt Lucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, wait a moment, darling. I want to have a good look at you. Tom gave
      me a bad account. And you are looking pale. You are not working too hard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; laughed Rose. &ldquo;And I am quite well. But I shall be glad
      when June comes, Aunt Lucy. I am beginning to count the days. But don&rsquo;t
      tell Pauline that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A delighted look flashed into Miss Merivale&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;My darling, it is so
      sweet to hear you say that. I was afraid you would find it dull here when
      you came back. I have missed you more than I could tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; asked Rose half wistfully, half teasingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had Miss
      Sampson, you know, Aunt Lucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you both,&rdquo; Miss Merivale said in an eager voice. &ldquo;Rose, you will
      try to love her, won&rsquo;t you? She is so lonely. Mrs. M&rsquo;Alister and her
      children have gone to Devonshire, and Rhoda was left behind. She has
      nobody but us. You won&rsquo;t treat her like a stranger, will you, dearest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose felt chilled and hurt by her aunt&rsquo;s strange eagerness. It was all
      very well for Tom to speak so, but her aunt was different. Why should she
      plead for Rhoda like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see how sweet I mean to be to her, Aunt Lucy,&rdquo; she said gaily; and
      Miss Merivale did not notice that the gaiety was forced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up now
      and send her down to you. I wonder why Pauline is keeping her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hastened away, and Miss Merivale sat down in the porch and put her
      hand on the head of Bruno, Tom&rsquo;s black Newfoundland, who had come to her
      side with an inquiring glance in his beautiful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your master will be home soon, Bruno,&rdquo; she said. The dog wagged his tail,
      but still kept looking at her. She went on speaking to him. &ldquo;And
      everything is coming right, Bruno,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am glad I was silent.
      It&rsquo;s all coming right. We shall all be happy together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked round as she spoke, and saw Rhoda coming down the broad shallow
      stairs into the wainscoted hall. A tender smile brightened her face as she
      watched her. She had lost the feeling that she was doing her an injustice
      by not acknowledging her as her niece. As Tom&rsquo;s wife she would be as a
      daughter to her. She would have everything that was hers by right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda stepped rather slowly down, her head bent, a line of anxiety showing
      between her clearly pencilled dark brows. She knew something about Pauline
      that she was beginning to feel Miss Merivale should know. Yet she had no
      wish to disclose the secret she had accidentally learnt. At first it had
      amused her, it amused her still. In the brief, decidedly unpleasant <i>tete-a-tete</i>
      which Rose had just put an end to, she had found it easy to bear Pauline&rsquo;s
      half-veiled taunts. Ever since her visit to Leyton she had understood the
      bitter animosity which Miss Smythe had shown her from the first. It was
      not altogether a personal dislike. Rhoda was sure that she would have
      treated in the same manner any girl who was poor and yet was not ashamed
      of her poverty or of her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rhoda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale&rsquo;s gentle call made her hurry her footsteps. Her face had a
      wonderfully sweet look on it as she approached Miss Merivale. Miss
      Merivale&rsquo;s kindness had completely won the girl&rsquo;s heart. She was so happy
      at Woodcote that sometimes she felt as if it must be a dream from which
      she would awake to find herself in the lonely bedroom in Acacia Road with
      the boys&rsquo; cots empty, and a long London day of searching for work to look
      forward to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down here beside me, dear,&rdquo; Miss Merivale said, taking her hand and
      drawing her down on the seat. &ldquo;Just look at Bruno. He has been asking me
      when Tom is coming back. I tell him he will be back in a few moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda had turned her head quickly away to look at the dog, but Miss
      Merivale saw how her colour rose, making even the little ear pink. And she
      smiled to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Tom will be able to go with us to-morrow,&rdquo; she went on, without
      giving Rhoda time to speak. &ldquo;I want to take Miss Smythe to Bingley woods.
      It is too early for a picnic, but we could drive over there directly after
      lunch. Ah, there is Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bruno had heard the click of the wicket gate leading to the stables before
      Miss Merivale spoke. So had Rhoda. She started up. &ldquo;I promised Wilmot I
      would light the lamps, Miss Merivale, as Ann is out. We shall want them
      for tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale let her go, smiling softly again to herself. &ldquo;Rose and Miss
      Smythe have come, Tom,&rdquo; she called to him, as he crossed the lawn,
      swinging his stick, and walking with a free, happy step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that. Where is Rosie? I&rsquo;m afraid I shall not be able to see
      much of her to-morrow, Aunt Lucy. I must go to Croydon, after all. But
      I&rsquo;ll get back early. How do you think Rose is looking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is pale, Tom; but she says she is very well. I don&rsquo;t think she likes
      it as much as she expected She is anxious to come home in June.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &ldquo;Yes, I gathered that on Tuesday. I am glad you let
      her go, Aunt Lucy. But there is no need for her to stay till June if she
      does not like it, is there? Why should she go back at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would be quite fair to Miss Smythe for her to leave her
      now, dear,&rdquo; said Miss Merivale gently. &ldquo;I am sure Rose would rather go
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their talk was interrupted by Rose herself, who came flying across the
      hall at the sight of Tom, followed more slowly by Pauline. &ldquo;Oh, Tom, have
      you come back? I drove Bob from the station. Did Aunt Lucy tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t had time. I have only just come in. How do you do, Miss
      Smythe? I hope Rose has been a good little girl since Tuesday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you, Rose?&rdquo; said Pauline, with a lazy smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose did not hear the question. She had caught sight of Rhoda entering the
      hall through the swing doors that led to Wilmot&rsquo;s pantry, and she stepped
      back to speak to her. They stood talking together by the wide stone
      hearth, filled now with green fir boughs. Pauline noticed how Tom&rsquo;s eyes
      kept wandering to them as he made disjointed remarks to her and his aunt,
      and he presently moved across the hall to join them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale got up from her seat in the porch. &ldquo;It is getting chilly, my
      dear,&rdquo; she said to Pauline. &ldquo;Shall we go into the dining-room? Tea will be
      ready in a few moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Pauline lingered in the hall. Though the twilight had begun to gather,
      enough light streamed through the great west window to make the portraits
      on the wainscoted walls clearly visible. Pauline went from one to the
      other, asking Miss Merivale a question now and then, but really far more
      intent on studying the group at the fireplace than the pictures she
      appeared to be interested in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the fireplace hung the portrait of Miss Merivale&rsquo;s mother, a sweet,
      gentle-eyed woman, very much like Miss Merivale, except that her eyes were
      a soft brown instead of a soft blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline remarked on the likeness at once. &ldquo;Except for the dark eyes, it
      might be your portrait, Miss Merivale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose had been glancing from the portrait to Rhoda. &ldquo;Aunt Lucy, your
      mother&rsquo;s eyes are exactly the same colour as Miss Sampson&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline, who was standing by Miss Merivale, felt her start violently. &ldquo;I
      had not noticed, dear,&rdquo; she said, without looking at Rhoda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but they are,&rdquo; Rose went on. &ldquo;Only Miss Sampson&rsquo;s are shaped a little
      differently. And she was named Rhoda, wasn&rsquo;t she, Aunt Lucy? Tom, don&rsquo;t
      you see the likeness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I do, Rosie,&rdquo; said Tom, who considered in his heart of hearts
      that Rhoda&rsquo;s long-lashed, sparkling dark eyes were far more beautiful than
      the mild brown ones in the portrait. As he spoke he moved quickly towards
      his aunt. &ldquo;Aunt Lucy, it is too cold for you here. Come in by the
      dining-room fire. Why, you are trembling with the cold. The evening is
      very chilly for April.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline stood still for a moment gazing intently up at the picture, and
      then followed the others into the dining-room. Before Tom had spoken to
      his aunt she had seen how white and strange her face was&mdash;as white as
      if she was about to faint. And a sudden idea had flashed upon Pauline,
      making her heart beat fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, when Rhoda was brushing her hair, she heard a soft tap at the
      door. To her surprise, it was Pauline who entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to borrow some matches,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I find my box is empty.
      How pretty your room is! So is mine. It is a charming house altogether.
      May I sit down and talk to you a little? I want you and Miss Merivale to
      spend a long day with us next week. Do you think you could persuade her to
      come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The change in Pauline&rsquo;s manner was so extraordinary that Rhoda found it
      difficult to speak. But Pauline did not appear to notice her constrained
      answer. She sat down in the low chair by the window and took up the
      photograph frame that stood there by Rhoda&rsquo;s little writing case and a
      saucer filled with white violets and moss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I look at this? It is your aunt and cousins, isn&rsquo;t it? What a dear
      little fellow that is on your aunt&rsquo;s lap! Is that the little boy who was
      ill? You took him into the country, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An irrepressible glimmer of fun came into Rhoda&rsquo;s dark eyes. &ldquo;Yes, into
      Essex,&rdquo; she said demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have all gone into the country now, haven&rsquo;t they? How fortunate it
      was that Miss Merivale heard me mention you, Miss Sampson! She noticed the
      name at once. It is quite certain, isn&rsquo;t it, that you are related to her
      through her sister&rsquo;s marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Merivale insists on thinking so,&rdquo; said Rhoda quietly. &ldquo;But I cannot
      be sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember your own people at all? I can feel for you, if that is
      so. My father and mother died while I was a baby. Can you remember your
      mother? I wish I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I cannot remember her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda&rsquo;s cold, brief replies checked Pauline. She did not find it so easy
      to pump Rhoda as she had expected. She put the photograph down, and got up
      with a yawn. &ldquo;I am keeping you up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;May I have the matches?
      Thank you. Good-night.&rdquo; She gave Rhoda one of her most charming smiles as
      she spoke; but Rhoda&rsquo;s good-night was studiously cold. She had no desire
      to accept the olive branch Pauline was holding out to her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. A CONFESSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The more Pauline thought of it the more she felt convinced that she had
      solved the mystery of Miss Merivale&rsquo;s sudden interest in Rhoda. And she
      spent a long time in considering what was the best use she could make of
      her discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first idea had been to disclose the truth to Rhoda herself, and thus
      establish a claim to her gratitude. But something in Rhoda&rsquo;s manner the
      night before made her hesitate. And she felt half inclined to believe that
      her best plan would be to speak to Miss Merivale and assure her that she
      could be trusted to keep silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still undecided when she went into the garden next morning to help
      Rose pick the flowers for the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda was already in the garden. Old Jackson, the gardener, had come to
      the house to seek her directly after breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jackson expects Rhoda to spend half the day in his company,&rdquo; Miss
      Merivale said, with a laugh. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t sow a seed without asking her
      opinion first. My opinions he has always laughed to scorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine too,&rdquo; said Rose, with a merry glance at Rhoda. &ldquo;He has always
      been a regular despot about the garden. How have you managed to subdue
      him, Miss Sampson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect he has found out that Miss Sampson knows more than he does,&rdquo;
       said Pauline smilingly. &ldquo;I want you to teach me something about flowers
      while I am here, Miss Sampson. I have schemes for a flower-box outside our
      windows at the flat. Don&rsquo;t you think that would be a delightful plan,
      Rosie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda made some fitting response, but Pauline discerned the coldness in
      her voice. She said angrily to herself that Rhoda did not deserve to know
      what she could tell her. And ten minutes later she had fully made up her
      mind to speak to Miss Merivale. It was another discovery which had led her
      to a decision. She had wandered on before Rose towards the end of the
      garden, where an archway through a clipped yew hedge led to the stables
      and farm buildings. Her steps made no sound on the turf path, and she
      suddenly came in sight of Tom and Rhoda standing close to the archway.
      Rhoda had her gardening gloves and apron on, and a trowel in her hand. She
      had just been sowing seeds in the bed that ran along the yew hedge. Tom
      had come through the archway to bid her good-bye before starting on his
      long ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I was going to Bingley woods with you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You will have a
      lovely day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it will be beautiful,&rdquo; Rhoda answered, finding it just as difficult
      as Tom did to speak these ordinary words in an ordinary tone. A blush came
      over her face, and she dropped her eyes. She could not meet his eager
      glance. For one moment Tom was silent&mdash;a moment that was eloquent to
      them both. Then, &ldquo;Rhoda!&rdquo; he said, almost below his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at that moment Pauline turned the corner by the great lilac bushes
      and caught sight of them. Rhoda came towards her instantly, showing no
      sign of discomposure except a controlled quivering at the corners of her
      firm lips; but Pauline was not deceived by her calmness. Her only doubt
      was as to whether Tom shared Miss Merivale&rsquo;s knowledge as to Rhoda&rsquo;s
      parentage. And after a moment or two&rsquo;s consideration she decided that he
      did not. It was impossible to look at Tom and doubt his perfect honesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short talk, he went through the archway to start on his ride, and
      Pauline returned to Rose, leaving Rhoda to her gardening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose, why didn&rsquo;t you warn me?&rdquo; she said in a tone of laughing reproach
      when she joined her. &ldquo;I am afraid your brother will never forgive me. I
      have just interrupted a <i>tête-à-tête</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Pauline?&rdquo; asked Rose, jarred through and through by her
      friend&rsquo;s tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible you don&rsquo;t guess, you blind girl? But perhaps you would
      rather I did not speak of it? I thought I could say anything to you,
      Rosie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke of Tom,&rdquo; Rose answered. &ldquo;Of course I know what you mean,
      Pauline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are jealous, Rosie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose flashed a glance at her. &ldquo;I am not jealous. I am not so horrid as
      that. But don&rsquo;t make a joke of it, Pauline, please don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline burst into a loud laugh. &ldquo;Oh, Rosie, what a solemn little face!
      But, seriously, do you think the course of true love is likely to run
      smooth? Surely your aunt will object. We are not all so unworldly and
      sentimental as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Lucy is glad, I am sure of it. And so am I,&rdquo; said Rose stoutly, &ldquo;I
      am beginning to see what Rhoda is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think Miss Merivale will be glad? Well, you are odd people. I shall
      begin to think Miss Sampson must have a fairy godmother. It&rsquo;s a new
      version of Cinderella, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This made Rose too angry to answer, and she walked away to the next
      flower-bed to put an end to the conversation. Pauline did not attempt to
      follow her. After standing in deep thought for a moment, she returned to
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale was sitting in the drawing-room busy with her embroidery.
      She looked up with a smile as Pauline entered. &ldquo;I was just wishing you or
      Rose would come in, Miss Smythe,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am not sure whether blue or
      green would be best for the centre of this flower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline gravely examined the embroidery, and gave her opinion. Then she
      took up the basket of silks. &ldquo;May I sort these for you, Miss Merivale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do, my dear. The kittens got hold of the basket just now and made sad
      work with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline seated herself at a little distance and began quickly and
      skilfully to arrange the basket, glancing once or twice at her companion.
      Miss Merivale looked very composed and cheerful. She was intent on her
      embroidery, and seemed in no hurry to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Pauline who began the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just been talking to Miss Sampson in the garden, Miss Merivale.
      How very happy she seems here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think she is happy, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you and Rosie had not come to the flat that afternoon, you might
      never have heard of her. How strangely things come about, don&rsquo;t they, dear
      Miss Merivale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad we came,&rdquo; Miss Merivale answered. &ldquo;What colour shall I use
      for this leaf, my dear? My eyes are not what they used to be, and I like
      to take advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline bent forward to look, and patiently discussed the question; but
      she spoke of Rhoda again directly it was decided. &ldquo;But something still
      more strange might have happened, Miss Merivale,&rdquo; she went on lightly.
      &ldquo;Suppose Miss Sampson had been your own niece? She might have been. People
      who are supposed to be lost in the bush aren&rsquo;t always lost, and&mdash;Oh,
      Miss Merivale, what have I said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale had dropped her work, and was staring at Pauline with
      wide-open, terrified eyes. She made no effort to answer her. She was
      incapable of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I said?&rdquo; repeated Pauline. She got up and came close to Miss
      Merivale, kneeling down beside her. &ldquo;You are angry with me. I have hurt
      you. Is it possible that Rhoda is your niece, and that you do not want her
      to know it? But you must trust me. Please trust me, Miss Merivale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale put her hand up to her eyes. She spoke in a stunned voice.
      Pauline&rsquo;s words had suddenly torn away the veil which had hidden the
      meaning of her own conduct from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Rhoda is my niece,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She is my sister Lydia&rsquo;s little girl.
      What made you guess it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline was slightly taken aback at this speech of Miss Merivale&rsquo;s. She
      had not expected her to admit the truth so readily. &ldquo;Miss Merivale, you
      must trust me,&rdquo; she said in a low, eager voice. &ldquo;I understand exactly why
      you want it to be a secret. No one shall ever know from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale pushed her chair back, freeing herself from the touch of
      Pauline&rsquo;s hands. A shock of repulsion had gone through her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be no secret after to-day,&rdquo; she said in the same stunned, heavy
      voice. &ldquo;I shall tell Tom this afternoon. I ought to have told him before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom came home late in the afternoon. He expected to find that his aunt and
      the girls had all gone to Bingley woods, and he only went to the house to
      change his riding boots before going to meet them. He passed through the
      archway in the yew hedge, marking with tender, happy eyes the exact spot
      where Rhoda had stood that morning while they talked together. His feet
      lingered a little as he went down the turf path to the house. Everything
      in the garden spoke to him of Rhoda, and it was in the garden he had seen
      her first.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went through the open window of the library and across the hall. As he
      reached the foot of the stairs he was surprised to hear his aunt&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing at the drawing-room door, with her hand resting heavily
      on the jamb. It was with difficulty she had crossed the room to call him
      on hearing his step. Her limbs were trembling under her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had all gone to Bingley woods,&rdquo; Tom exclaimed. &ldquo;Have the
      others gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I would not let them stay at home. I was feeling too tired to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You caught cold yesterday in the porch,&rdquo; Tom said in a playful scolding
      voice. &ldquo;You do want a lot of looking after, Aunt Lucy. Have you a fire?
      The wind is keen, though the sun is so bright. Here, let me make a better
      fire than this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knelt down on the rug, stirring the logs into a cheerful blaze. Miss
      Merivale sank down on the sofa and watched him in silence. If Tom had
      looked attentively at her, he would have seen that her face was grey with
      pain. She had spent some bitter hours since Pauline had spoken to her that
      morning. Though she had done it for Tom&rsquo;s sake, she feared that he would
      find it very hard to forgive her. And looking back over the last few
      weeks, she found it almost impossible to understand how she could have
      been happy for a moment while keeping such a secret from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knowledge that Pauline shared the secret had been like a light brought
      into a dark room. Her shock of repulsion at Pauline&rsquo;s eagerness to
      convince her that she would be silent had been followed by the sad
      reflection that she had no right to blame Pauline for being willing to do
      what she herself had done for a month past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that is better,&rdquo; Tom said, getting up. &ldquo;Let me draw your sofa
      close up to the fire. Where is your knitting, Aunt Lucy? I know you can&rsquo;t
      have your afternoon nap without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Merivale did not laugh at the old joke that she pretended to be
      knitting when she was really fast asleep. &ldquo;Tom, sit down,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      want to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom hesitated. She had spoken in so low a tone he had not noticed how her
      voice trembled. &ldquo;I thought I would go to meet them, Aunt Lucy. They will
      be coming back by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she repeated more urgently. &ldquo;I want to speak to you. I must
      tell you before they come home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was thoroughly startled now. &ldquo;Has anything happened?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What is
      it?&rdquo; He drew a chair close to her and sat down, his square, honest face
      full of concern. &ldquo;What is it, Aunt Lucy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away from him. It was more difficult to speak than she had
      expected, though she had known it would be very difficult. &ldquo;Tom, it is
      about Rhoda,&rdquo; she said in a choked voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He straightened himself in his chair. &ldquo;About Rhoda?&rdquo; he echoed. She heard
      the challenge in his grave voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, about Rhoda. I want to tell you why I asked her here. You know that
      I love her, Tom. You know how happy it has made me to see that you&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Aunt Lucy, I was sure you had guessed,&rdquo; Tom said in an eager voice.
      &ldquo;And&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, wait,&rdquo; she said breathlessly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand me yet. Has it
      never struck you as strange that I should have asked Rhoda to live here,
      that I should have treated her as a child of my own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, Tom was not able to say that he had thought it strange. Rhoda being
      Rhoda, it had seemed to him most natural that his aunt should have loved
      her at first sight, just as he had done. But his voice was anxious as he
      answered, &ldquo;Aunt Lucy, I don&rsquo;t understand in the least what you are driving
      at. What is it you want to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned towards him, clasping her hands together. &ldquo;Tom, Rhoda is
      Lydia&rsquo;s little girl. She is my own niece. I have known it ever since the
      first day she came to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her, not comprehending. &ldquo;How can she be Cousin Lydia&rsquo;s
      child?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;She would have known you were her aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not. She knows nothing. But, Tom, she is Lydia&rsquo;s daughter. I
      know it. I have known it all these weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why&rdquo;&mdash;he began, and then stopped, a dark flush rising in his
      face. He knew why his aunt had been silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, at first I tried to persuade myself I was mistaken,&rdquo; she faltered.
      &ldquo;And then, when I saw&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a quick gesture that was full of pain. The flush in his face had
      faded, leaving it very white. &ldquo;Aunt Lucy, do not speak of that,&rdquo; he said,
      turning his face aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration: HE STARED AT HER, NOT COMPREHENDING.}
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew closer to him, putting her hand on his arm. &ldquo;Tom, what do you
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; he returned, just glancing at her and then looking away
      again. &ldquo;You have made it impossible, Aunt Lucy. I could never ask her to
      marry me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bitterness in his voice overwhelmed her. &ldquo;Tom, you don&rsquo;t suppose she
      would believe that you&mdash;Oh, what have I done? Tom, you will never
      forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of the quick sob that choked her voice he turned quickly to
      her. &ldquo;Aunt Lucy, do not talk like that. What is done can&rsquo;t be undone. But
      let me understand. What proofs have you that Rhoda is your niece? You must
      write to Mr. Thomson and tell him all you know. But he will want proofs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke so quietly, she took courage. And she was able to speak fully to
      him. He listened with grave intentness, asking a question now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must write to this Mr. Harding,&rdquo; he said, when she had finished. &ldquo;Mrs.
      M&rsquo;Alister will be sure to know his address. Shall I go up and see Mr.
      Thomson for you to-morrow, Aunt Lucy? I think the first step is to tell
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Rhoda, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till I have seen Thomson. Though there seems no room for doubt. Aunt
      Lucy, I wish you had told me at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How she wished it she tried to tell him, but her tears prevented her. She
      sobbed hysterically, while he did his best to soothe her, forgetting his
      own pain at the sight of hers. When she could speak, her first words were
      of Rhoda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, you won&rsquo;t let this come between you? Tom dear, I know she loves
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face quivered all over. &ldquo;I have no right to speak to her yet,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;but I must wait. Can&rsquo;t you see it must be so? I shall
      have my own way to make in the world.&rdquo; He squared his shoulders as he said
      it, as if eager to begin the struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, I don&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; his aunt burst out. But he would not let her go on.
      He could not bear it. He felt that it was utterly impossible for him to
      ask Rhoda to marry him if she was heiress of Woodcote and he without a
      penny he could call his own. If they had met knowing their relative
      positions, it might have been different. But now he could make no claim on
      her. His aunt&rsquo;s conduct had raised a barrier between them that could not
      be broken down till he had won an independent position for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale&rsquo;s heart ached as she looked at him, but she was far from
      understanding the full bitterness of the blow she had inflicted on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom felt as if he had suddenly grown old. He left his aunt presently and
      went out into the open air. He no longer felt inclined to go and meet the
      pony carriage, but he went through the wood to the furzy common beyond.
      From there he could see the high road stretching like a white ribbon
      across the downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      No pony carriage was in sight, but a traction engine was lumbering heavily
      upwards, with a man walking before it carrying a red flag. Tom was glad to
      see it disappear over the dip of the hill. The lane from Bingley woods
      entered the high road lower down the hill. There was no danger of Bob&rsquo;s
      nerves being shaken by the sight of the fiery-throated monster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road lay white and silent in the sunshine now. Tom sat down on a turf
      hillock, fixing his eyes drearily upon it. He felt intensely miserable.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. POLLY SMITH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The expedition to Bingley woods was not a success. Pauline was in one of
      her worst tempers, and treated Rose so rudely that the poor girl was more
      ashamed of her chosen friend than angry with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Rhoda, Pauline was all that was sweet and flattering. She had promised
      Miss Merivale to say nothing to her; but she was eager to ingratiate
      herself with the girl whom she now knew to be an heiress, and to make her
      forget how she had treated her while she was Clare&rsquo;s assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda was strongly irritated by her advances. Pauline&rsquo;s snubs had never
      wounded her very deeply. Rhoda only valued the good opinion of those whom
      she respected. But Pauline&rsquo;s eagerness to make friends turned her
      indifference to something like violent dislike. She found it hardly
      possible to speak civilly to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went off at last into the depths of the wood, leaving Rose and Pauline
      together. Her irritation soon passed away when she was alone. The basket
      she had brought to fill with primroses remained empty in her hands. She
      wandered on, her eyes drinking in the beauty round her. Only the lower
      boughs of the trees were in leaf as yet, and the wood was full of golden
      light. Primroses were everywhere, and in the more open spaces celandines
      starred the ground with deeper yellow. In a month the glades between the
      trees would be carpeted by bluebells. But there were no bluebells yet.
      Spring was still in its infancy. The great oaks that skirted the wood
      stretched bare wintry boughs over the flowers beneath them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a time of hope, of delicate, exquisite promise; and Rhoda&rsquo;s lips
      curved with a happy, dreamy smile, as she listened to the story the woods
      whispered to her that April day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deep voice of the clock in Bingley church tower recalled her to the
      necessity of going back to her companions. It was four o&rsquo;clock, the time
      they had fixed for starting homewards. It was not with any pleasure that
      she thought of the long drive. She suspected that Pauline and Rose had had
      a serious quarrel, and that Pauline&rsquo;s politeness to her arose from a wish
      to vex Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way to the woods Pauline had criticised Rose&rsquo;s driving, speaking
      with authority, as if she had driven a pony carriage all her life. Rhoda
      could have laughed outright if she had not been so angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found the two girls ready to start for the village when she got back
      to the spot where she had left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pauline wants to go round by the high road,&rdquo; Rose said, looking
      appealingly at Rhoda. &ldquo;It will make us much later at home. You can see the
      Abbey another day, Pauline. There isn&rsquo;t much to see; is there, Miss
      Sampson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not take us half an hour longer. How obstinate you are, Rosie!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Pauline irritably. &ldquo;I will drive, and make Bob understand that
      he must hurry a little. Why should we walk up that long tiresome lane to
      save his legs? There is no hill to speak of the other way, you say. I am
      too tired to walk a step. I am not so strong as you are. Miss Sampson,
      don&rsquo;t you agree with me that the high road will be much the better way for
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We promised Miss Merivale that we would be back early,&rdquo; Rhoda said
      coldly. &ldquo;I think it is a pity to go out of our way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we should be at home just as soon. Rose insists that we must all walk
      up the lane. I am sure you are too tired to do it, Miss Sampson, if I was
      not. But Bob is to be considered before either of us, eh, Rose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose walked down the turf slope towards the village without answering; she
      was too cross to discuss the question any further.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new complication arose when they reached the rustic inn where Bob and
      the carriage had been left. One of Bob&rsquo;s shoes was found to be loose, and
      it was necessary to get it fixed before starting for home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose drew Rhoda aside, and spoke eagerly to her. &ldquo;Miss Sampson, would you
      drive home with Pauline? I could walk across the downs and be home in half
      an hour. I don&rsquo;t like to leave Aunt Lucy so long alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let me go?&rdquo; Rhoda answered, as eagerly as Rose had spoken. &ldquo;I
      know the way quite well. I would so much rather go, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose could quite well understand that Rhoda must find Pauline&rsquo;s society
      unpleasant, even though Pauline now appeared bent on being agreeable to
      her. &ldquo;Are you sure you know the way?&rdquo; she said doubtfully. &ldquo;But it is
      easy. You will see Woodcote when once you are on the top of the downs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the way quite well,&rdquo; Rhoda said, with a bright face. It was
      delightful to her to escape the drive home with Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started at once, and was soon on the top of the downs, enjoying the
      breezy expanse of beautiful rolling country round her. Half an hour&rsquo;s
      rapid walking brought her to the furzy common close to Woodcote woods. She
      had come down to it from the downs; and Tom, seated on his hillock, with
      his eyes turned to the road, did not become aware of her presence till she
      was quite close to him. He had been hidden by the gorse bushes from Rhoda
      till the moment before he started up. And she would have shyly hurried on
      without speaking to him if the sound of her step had not made him look
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurriedly explained how she came to be there alone. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
      they will be back for an hour or more,&rdquo; she said, looking at the white
      ribbon of road Tom had been watching for so long. &ldquo;The high road is much
      longer than the lane, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom briefly. He had forgotten all about the traction engine.
      In fact, he had hardly understood what Rhoda was saying. His heart was
      heavy within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned and walked down the sunny bit of slope, where the bees were
      busy among the golden gorse blossoms. Tom was not silent. He could not
      trust himself to be silent. He began to speak of the meeting he had just
      been attending at Croydon. He gave Rhoda a vivid account of it, which
      lasted till they got close to the house; then, with a hasty excuse of
      having forgotten to tell Jackson something, he left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda walked on to the house with a calm, even step. Wilmot, who met her
      in the hall, and told her that Miss Merivale was lying down and did not
      wish to be disturbed, noticed nothing unusual about her. She stood and
      talked some minutes with the old servant before going upstairs to her
      room. And she gave her a sunny smile as she left her. Even when she was
      alone, and had shut the door between her and the world, she did not fling
      herself down by the bed and burst into tears, as unhappy heroines so often
      do. She changed her dress, and carefully mended a rent the briers had made
      in the one she took off. Then she got <i>Hamblin Smith&rsquo;s Arithmetic</i>
      and her notebook, and began the hour&rsquo;s work she set herself every day. A
      tear or two did come&mdash;she could not keep them back; but she worked
      steadily on. She would not even allow herself to think how she could have
      offended Tom, or what the explanation of his changed manner could be. She
      picked out the hardest examples in Complex Fractions she could find, and
      concentrated her mind on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still working when Wilmot came to her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Rose and Miss Smythe have not come home, miss. Shall I send in tea?
      It is past six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda opened the door. &ldquo;I will go and ask Miss Merivale, Wilmot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilmot looked doubtful. Her mistress had given strict orders that she was
      not to be disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not go in,&rdquo; Rhoda said, as she saw her doubtful glance. &ldquo;I will
      just knock softly. If she is awake, she might be glad of a cup of tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda&rsquo;s first knock was not answered; but when she tapped softly again,
      she heard Miss Merivale&rsquo;s voice telling her to come in. Miss Merivale was
      lying on the bed, with her face turned to the wall. She reached out her
      hand for Rhoda&rsquo;s, and clasped it tenderly, but did not turn round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My head is very bad, darling. Tell Rose I won&rsquo;t have any tea. I want to
      keep quite quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda did not tell her that Rose and Pauline had not returned. She was
      afraid she might be alarmed. The deadly pallor of her face quite
      frightened her. She spoke to Tom when she went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Merivale looks very ill,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and she won&rsquo;t let me do
      anything for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom was sitting at the table before the hall window, busy making flies for
      his trout fishing. He was so intent on his work that he did not look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gets bad headaches. I should not be anxious. She always likes to be
      left alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda did not answer this. She went into the dining-room, where tea was
      laid ready, and sat down in the broad window-seat with some needlework.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Tom had come in then, she would have been very cold to him. Her pride
      was up in arms. But he did not come near her; and for a miserable half
      hour Rhoda sat there alone, feeling as if all life&rsquo;s music had suddenly
      stopped, and winter had taken the place of spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilmot came in at last to urge her to have some tea. &ldquo;Miss Rosie may be
      stopping to tea at the Rectory. It isn&rsquo;t any good for you and Mr. Tom to
      wait any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda looked at the clock in some alarm. She had not been conscious of the
      lapse of time. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Miss Rosie meant to stop anywhere, Wilmot.
      But they ought to be home. I hope nothing has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Tom entered the room. &ldquo;It is getting very late,&rdquo; he said to
      Rhoda. &ldquo;How long did Jones mean to take to put that shoe right? Not very
      long, surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Merivale thought they would be at home by six o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Rhoda
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is seven now,&rdquo; Tom said, glancing at the clock. &ldquo;It will be dark
      in half an hour. They were coming by the high road all the way, didn&rsquo;t you
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Miss Smythe did not want to go up the lane. But the high road is not
      very much longer, is it, Mr. Merivale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About two miles longer. But it is a better road. They ought to be home by
      this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda was standing by the window, and he came to her side and looked out.
      He carefully avoided glancing at her, yet he knew that her face was very
      proud and cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I will go down the road to meet them,&rdquo; he said. His voice shook a
      little. It was very hard&mdash;it was almost harder than he could bear&mdash;to
      let her go on misunderstanding him. Yet how could he explain?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish they would come home,&rdquo; Rhoda answered. &ldquo;Do go and meet them, Mr.
      Merivale. Miss Smythe wanted to drive, and I do not trust her driving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob doesn&rsquo;t want much driving,&rdquo; Tom answered. But as he spoke he suddenly
      remembered the traction engine crawling up the hill. For the first time he
      felt really alarmed. &ldquo;I will go down the road,&rdquo; he said, moving quickly
      from the window. &ldquo;Though I daresay I shall meet them almost at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilmot followed him into the hall. &ldquo;Mr. Tom, where can they be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere on the road between Bingley and our gates,&rdquo; he said lightly.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t alarm Miss Sampson or my aunt, Wilmot. But send Ann round to the
      stables to tell Jack to get my horse ready. If I do not see any sign of
      them on the road, I will ride towards Bingley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went off; and Rhoda, after watching him down the drive, crept upstairs
      to listen at Miss Merivale&rsquo;s door. But as she crossed the landing the door
      opened, and Miss Merivale stepped out, a black lace shawl framing the
      whiteness of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rhoda, where has Tom gone?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;How still the house is! Haven&rsquo;t
      Rose and Miss Smythe come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; answered Rhoda lightly. &ldquo;Bob&rsquo;s shoe got loose, you know. They
      were delayed at the village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is nearly dark. Something must have happened. Let us go down to
      the gate, Rhoda. I am frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda could not persuade her to let her go alone, and they went together
      down the drive. Tom had just ridden off; they could hear the sound of his
      horse&rsquo;s feet on the hilly road. But when that died away, a long period of
      silence ensued. They went out of the gates and down the hill towards the
      station, Miss Merivale clinging to Rhoda.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after what seemed hours to them both that they heard a horse
      trotting rapidly towards them. Miss Merivale leant against the low stone
      wall that divided the road on one side from the common.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rhoda, that is Tom. I could tell Black Beauty&rsquo;s trot anywhere. Go on to
      meet him, dear. I cannot go any farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda went quickly on. It was Tom; he sprang off his horse on catching
      sight of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Smythe has been badly hurt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She is at the Rectory. Rose
      is with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister is not hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bruise or two. They met that traction engine; Miss Smythe was driving,
      and tried to make Bob pass it. The result was that Bob bolted down the
      hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were walking quickly up the hill as he spoke. Rhoda told him that
      Miss Merivale was waiting for them, and a couple of moments brought them
      to her side. She refused to accept at first Tom&rsquo;s emphatic assurances that
      Rose had escaped with only a bruise or two, and begged him to take her to
      the Rectory. Tom would not hear of her going. &ldquo;Rose did not want to leave
      Miss Smythe, or I would have brought her home, Aunt Lucy. She is perfectly
      well. Rose is a plucky little girl She wasn&rsquo;t half as frightened as you
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not till they got back to the house and he had made Miss Merivale
      drink the cup of tea Wilmot brought her, that he allowed her to know how
      serious Pauline&rsquo;s injuries were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They fear concussion of the brain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have promised Hartley to
      telegraph for her friends. Can you give me their address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale hesitated. &ldquo;I am afraid she has no near relatives, poor
      girl. I never heard her speak of any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is continually calling for &lsquo;Granny,&rsquo; Mrs. Hartley says. Her
      grandmother ought to be here, if she has one. How could we find out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda, who had been sitting silent till then, now looked up and spoke.
      &ldquo;Her grandparents live at Leyton, Miss Merivale. They have a shop next
      door to Aunt Mary&rsquo;s brother. Mr. Smith is a grocer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merivale stared at her. &ldquo;My dear, are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; Rhoda answered. &ldquo;I saw her photograph when I took little
      Hugh to his uncle&rsquo;s, and they talked a great deal about her. Polly, they
      call her. She writes to them constantly. They brought her up, and I expect
      she is really very fond of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;Rhoda, are you quite sure? Why has she never spoken of them? Do
      you think she was ashamed of the shop? It must have been that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had no reason to be ashamed,&rdquo; Rhoda answered quietly. &ldquo;They are dear,
      good people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor girl, poor girl!&rdquo; was all Miss Merivale could say; but Tom, who had
      brought a telegraph form from the library, asked Rhoda to give him the
      address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send this off at once,&rdquo; he said, getting up. &ldquo;She evidently wants
      to have her grandmother with her now. She calls continually for her.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII. CONCLUSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the twelve o&rsquo;clock train stopped at the station next morning two
      passengers got out&mdash;a little old lady dressed with Quaker-like
      neatness, and a tall, grizzled, sunburnt man with a breezy, open-air look
      about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom and the Rector were both waiting on the platform, and hurried up to
      them. There was good news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your granddaughter is better, Mrs. Smith,&rdquo; the Rector said in his kind
      voice. &ldquo;But she may not know you. You must not be alarmed at that. The
      doctor is much more hopeful this morning, and she calls continually for
      you. We trust it may soothe her to have you near her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears were streaming fast over Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s wrinkled face. &ldquo;Polly
      would never have no one but me to nurse her,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She was always
      like that from a baby. I came off the first minute I could. Mr. Smith
      wasn&rsquo;t able to leave the shop, but Mr. Harding came with me. I&rsquo;ve never
      travelled alone in my life, and I&rsquo;d have lost my way sure enough without
      him. Mr. Harding&rsquo;s from Australia, sir,&rdquo; she added, looking at Tom, whom
      she had identified as Mr. Merivale. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;d be glad to see Miss Sampson
      if she&rsquo;s still with Miss Merivale supposing &lsquo;twas convenient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going back to Woodcote now,&rdquo; Tom said, looking at Mr. Harding. He
      had started violently at the first mention of his name by Mrs. Smith, but
      he spoke coolly enough. &ldquo;Will you walk back with me? My aunt will be very
      glad to see you. Miss Sampson is now at the Rectory, but I am going to
      fetch her and my sister after lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rector&rsquo;s trap was waiting outside, and Mrs. Smith was soon comfortably
      settled in it. She was too simple and homely to be shy, and it was plain
      both to the Rector and Tom that her distress at Pauline&rsquo;s accident was
      largely mingled with delight at the prospect of having her to nurse. She
      spoke with eagerness to the Rector as they drove off of the time when she
      could take Polly back with her to Leyton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a good sort,&rdquo; Mr. Harding said, as he and Tom turned to walk up the
      hill. &ldquo;I hope her Polly will soon be better. She is a governess, isn&rsquo;t
      she? Price told me she didn&rsquo;t spend much time with the old folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom did not feel called upon to answer this. He was determined to find out
      at once how much Mr. Harding knew about Rhoda&rsquo;s father and mother. &ldquo;My
      aunt and I were talking about you yesterday, Mr. Harding, but we had no
      idea that you were in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harding turned his keen black eyes upon him. &ldquo;No, I only landed last
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aunt has some reason to believe that Miss Sampson is related to her,&rdquo;
       Tom hurried on. &ldquo;You knew her father well, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harding&rsquo;s answer was emphatic. &ldquo;I should say I did, sir. Poor old Jack
      and I were boys together. Why, he married a cousin of mine, as good as a
      sister. And we should have been partners now if he hadn&rsquo;t died. Some
      people never understood Jack, and after Jenny died he got queerer than
      ever; but he and I never had a cloud between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom had stopped still in the road. The ground seemed to be swaying under
      his feet, and something caught him in the throat so that he could scarcely
      speak. &ldquo;Was your cousin Rhoda&rsquo;s mother?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she was their only child. I knew she was safe and happy with the
      M&rsquo;Alisters, or I would have looked after her more. I&rsquo;ve no chick nor child
      of my own, and I mean Rhoda to have a big slice of what I&rsquo;ve got to
      leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom did not catch the last words clearly. &ldquo;My aunt&rsquo;s sister married a Mr.
      James Sampson,&rdquo; he hurried to say. &ldquo;Was he related to Miss Sampson&rsquo;s
      father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that was Jim. He got lost in the bush, poor fellow. He had his girl
      with him. Yes, he was Jack&rsquo;s brother. They lived close together in
      Melbourne. I fancy Rhoda was named after Jim&rsquo;s little girl. They were
      about the same age; but Jenny died when Rhoda was a year old, and Jack
      left Melbourne for Adelaide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Tom and Mr. Harding reached the house, he went hastily in search of
      his aunt. He found her in her own room, her eyes dim with weeping. She
      started up at the sight of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Tom, what have you come to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few rapid words he made her understand. &ldquo;You see how your mistake
      arose, Aunt Lucy. They both had the same name, Rhoda and Cousin Lydia&rsquo;s
      little girl. And Cousin Lydia must have given that locket to Rhoda&rsquo;s
      mother or to Rhoda&rsquo;s father for her when they left Melbourne. But come
      down and speak to Mr. Harding. There is no need for him to know the
      mistake you fell into. Let us forget it, Aunt Lucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, Miss Merivale&rsquo;s tears began to flow afresh. &ldquo;Oh, Tom, I have told
      Rhoda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told her? Why did you? I thought we had decided to wait till I had
      seen Thomson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, I could not help it. She was so miserable, poor child. She tried to
      hide it, but she could not hide it from me. She thought she had offended
      you. I do not know what she thought. How could you treat her so
      differently? Do you think you will get her to forgive you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A glimmer of a smile showed itself in Miss Merivale&rsquo;s eyes as she spoke.
      But Tom could not smile yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you told her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did she believe you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But she declared that nothing would induce her to claim her
      rights if she had any. She said there were no proofs, and if she had them
      she would not produce them. She spoke very strongly, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom made no answer for a moment. &ldquo;She has gone to the Rectory?&rdquo; he said
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she was anxious to go. But she is going to walk home across the
      downs. I think she was anxious to avoid you, Tom. No wonder! How could you
      make her so unhappy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom did not point out that he had been far more unhappy, and that it was
      all Miss Merivale&rsquo;s fault. He looked at his aunt, giving her now back
      smile for smile. &ldquo;Aunt Lucy, will you go and fetch Rose?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose was delighted to see her aunt in the carriage when she ran out to
      meet it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rhoda did not think you would be able to come, Aunt Lucy. Were you very
      much frightened when you heard about it? Poor Rhoda looks quite ill But
      Pauline is really better. She has slept since her grandmother came. She
      knew her directly, and has held her hand tight ever since. Poor old lady,
      she is so fond of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we could move her to Woodcote,&rdquo; Miss Merivale said. &ldquo;I must speak
      to the doctor about it. I will go and see Mrs. Prance for a moment, Rosie
      darling. And then we will go home. Oh, my darling, I am so thankful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held Rose close to her, and kissed her once or twice before she let
      her go. Till that moment she had hardly been able to realise her happiness
      in having Rose safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose began to talk again of Pauline as they were driving home. &ldquo;How
      strange she could be so silent about her grandmother and yet be so fond of
      her, Aunt Lucy! Or do you think that she is only fond of her when she
      wants her? She was calling for her over and over again all last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect she is really fond of her, dear. As fond as she can be of
      anybody. I don&rsquo;t wish to speak harshly of her, Rose, and we will do all we
      can for her. But you must not live with her again. Not because her
      grandmother is Mrs. Smith,&rdquo; added Miss Merivale quickly, afraid that Rose
      might misunderstand her. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that. Rhoda&rsquo;s people are in the same
      rank of life as the Smiths, yet Rhoda is a true gentlewoman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Lucy, I could not live with Pauline again,&rdquo; Rose said earnestly.
      &ldquo;Besides, I want to live at home. I believe I shall loathe the thought of
      a flat as long as I live. Pauline has effectually cured me of my desire to
      live in one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She and Mrs. Smith must come to stay with us as soon as she can be
      moved,&rdquo; Miss Merivale said. &ldquo;Perhaps this illness will make her see things
      differently, Rosie. Let us hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rhoda knew all the time,&rdquo; Rose said, after a moment&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;Poor
      Pauline, how angry she would have been if she had guessed it! If I had
      been Rhoda, I should have told her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should not have known where to telegraph if it had not been for Rhoda.
      Her uncle&mdash;Mr. M&rsquo;Alister&rsquo;s brother, I mean&mdash;has a shop next door
      to Mr. Price. It was he who told Mr. Harding that Rhoda was with us. I
      fancy he was rather distressed to find that she was not with Mrs.
      M&rsquo;Alister. But I think I have convinced him that we have taken good care
      of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom and Mr. Harding were outside the porch together when the carriage drew
      up. While Mr. Harding talked to Rose, Tom drew his aunt aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Lucy, will you go up to Rhoda?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him one shining look, and went quickly in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda had heard the carriage enter, and was standing in the middle of the
      room when Miss Merivale softly knocked and entered. There was a tremulous,
      eager, anxious look in the girl&rsquo;s face. Happy as she was, she could not be
      quite happy till she was sure Miss Merivale was content.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was only a tiny shadow of doubt that clouded the brightness, and
      when Miss Merivale clasped her close, and kissed her as fondly and
      tenderly as she had kissed Rose a little while before, it nearly all fled
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I am delighted,&rdquo; Miss Merivale said, with happy tears in her
      voice. &ldquo;Tom has always been like a son to me, and now you will be my
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are not sorry you asked me here?&rdquo; Rhoda whispered. She felt she
      must ask the question once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Tom if he thinks I am sorry,&rdquo; returned Miss Merivale, kissing her
      again. And this was answer enough. Rhoda doubted no more.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
